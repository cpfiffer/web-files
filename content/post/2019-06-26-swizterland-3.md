Not much news today. We had the morning off, presumably so that some students could work on their presentations. The afternoon included five presentations, generally covering

- A theoretical examination of the impacts of financial transaction taxes
- The effect of speed bumps on market liquidity
- The asymmetric returns volatility effect (theory and empirics)
- Determinants of market fragmentation
- The effects of primary issuance on secondary market liquidity

The presentation quality was pretty excellent, overall.
