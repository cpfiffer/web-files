Yesterday I gave a talk on Turing.jl, and I think I only made 5-9 mistakes. You can check it out on YouTube:

There were also some spectacular talks by the other probabilitistic programming languages in Julia. 
Chad Scherrer (who is pretty great)  covered [Soss.jl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Oof2wS-0A), 
which has a pretty slick syntax and what I would consider an admirable user interface. Gen.jl had a 
[remarkable presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7mc1wXPZR8) from Alex Lew 
(who is also pretty great) that has a really fascinating perspective on inference.
