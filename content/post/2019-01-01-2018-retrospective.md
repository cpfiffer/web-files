It's a new year, and I've gathered some notes from the year gone by.

# Achievements

* Became a C# software developer.
* Went to Miami.
* Passed CFA Level One.
* Learned [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), got better at [Julia](https://julialang.org/), introduced myself to [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), and [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/).
* Started a [PhD](https://business.uoregon.edu/faculty/cameron-pfiffer).
* Visited my grandmother in upstate New York with my brother.
* Built and designed a tool to detect outlier performance in investment activities.
* Endured a lot of Southern Oregon's wildfire smoke.
* Moved from Medford, OR to Eugene, OR.
* Finally got a piano in the house again. It is super out of tune so I've mostly been playing honky tonk blues and stuff.
* Started working on [Turing](http://turing.ml/).
* Drilled through a bunch of 220v electrical lines.
* Attended the Pacific Northwest Finance Conference in Seattle.
* Had my first ever office hours.
* Rowed 5km in 23:03. 
* Deadlifted 220lbs.
* Made it through the first academic term with some pretty good grades. Courses taken so far are:
  * Math Camp 
  * Core Microeconomics 1 (Consumer theory, mostly)
  * Econometrics 1 (Mathematical statistics)
  * Accounting Theory and Disclosure (disclosure theory, what accounting does, etc.)
* Not insane yet.

# Goals

* Learn more about market microstructure. It's a fascinating field and nobody is going to tell me everything I want to know, so I have to make an effort to do so myself.
* Keep up my programming skills. Don't get stale.
* Really get better at understanding the nuance of MCMC methods. There's a lot of beauty there that needs to be unpacked.
* Row a 5km in 22:30.
* Save up enough to purchase a desktop computer. 
* Be better about remembering stuff. 
* Write at least one post a month.
* Read academic papers more deliberately. Keep better summaries and focus on what matters. 
* Broaden my repertoire of left-hand licks (grooves? base lines? I have no idea) to include things requiring greater hand independence.
* Do great in all my coursework.

# Bullets

I do a type of pseudo-bullet journaling, where I write down a couple of points from various days. Here are some of my favorites. I tend to swear a lot on in my journal, so I have censored them in accordance with the fact that I'm sort of a professional adult.

- January 11th - "C# isn't a terrible language."
- January 14th - "Had brownies for lunch and breakfast."
- January 15th - "steroid injections hurt"
- January 21st - "Flying is stupid and I hate it."
- January 23rd - "Passed CFA level one, which means I have to keep going. *\*\*\*."
- January 26th - "Being paid money is nice."
- January 28th - "I want to make a cryptocurrency exchange where the rules change every day. That'd be fun."
- February 3rd - "Liz made some bomb-ass chili for dinner."
- February 17th - "Tried to refinance the car, failed dramatically."
- February 20th - "Bricked my Linux partition after trying to remove Python 2. Time for bed."
- March 8th - "Seems nobody has tried to break into the house yet."
- March 20th - "Another day, another step towards an inevitable death." Hilariously, this is immediately followed with "Nothing interesting happened today."
- March 27th - "Worked on code all day. It was nice."
- May 24th - "Made Assist reading time go from 13 minutes to 30 seconds." The assist is a giant CSV parser we used at work, for background on this.
- June 10th - "Filled the pond with vinegar."
- July 12th - "Biked in $104^âˆ˜$ weather. It was OK."
- August 10th - "Made fancy mac + cheese."
- August 24th - "I am officially unemployed."
- September 11th - "I hate bus people. I should take my bike more." This didn't happen much. I live 12 miles one-way from school, and it's about two hours of biking a day to commute that way. I have done this kind of thing in the past and it is not great. Good way to lose 80 pounds, though.
- September 14th - "I made lava cake. Lava cake is _dope_."
- September 27th - "While putting up a pot rack, we hit an electrical line."
- October 11th - "Drank beer and worked on data structures." I am unclear about what this means.
- November 18th - "Drilled through **another** electrical cable in the wall, this time for the dryer. \*\*\*\* everything." Hilariously, this was a second attempt to install the pot rack introduced on September 27th.
- December 9th - "The mice in the ceiling continue to be spectacularly annoying."
