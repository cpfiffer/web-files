<p>I just started reading a book called <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/How_to_Prove_it.html?id=murSjwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=en">How to Prove It: A Structured Approach</a>, a book all about writing and understanding proofs. My unconventional background in mathematics means that I have a fair bit of terror when it comes to proofs; they have often come up on more quantitative finance courses in a tangential manner, as the proofs are often unnessecary. The fact remains that I am terrified by them, and wanted to get over my fear of proofs.</p>
<p>In the process, I read a bit on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number">perfect numbers</a>. One of the proofs in the book was Euclid’s proof about infinite primes, and I figured I should write a little bit of code to find perfect numbers, for gits and shiggles.</p>
<p>Here’s the code to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliquot_sum">aliquot sums</a> in Julia, a necessary intermediate step in perfect number evaluation.</p>
<pre><code>using Primes

function aliquot(x::Int64, verbose=false)
    divisors = []
    for i in 1:x-1
        if(x%i == 0)
            append!(divisors, i)
        end
    end
    if verbose == true print(divisors) end
    return sum(divisors)
end</code></pre>
<p>This is a function for computing the next prime number after integer <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>function next_perfect(x::Int64, limit=Inf64)
    # Given a number, find the next highest perfect number.
    found = false
    while(found==false)
        # You can set a computational limit with the &#39;limit&#39; argument.
        if (x &gt;= limit) break end
        if aliquot(x) == x
            print(x, &quot; is the next perfect number.&quot;)
            found=true
            break
        end
        x += 1
    end
    return x
end</code></pre>
