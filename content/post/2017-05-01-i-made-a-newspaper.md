A couple of my friends here at the University of Reading came up with an excellent idea to start a financial newspaper. The concept was that the society[^1] would collect articles on investing and other things finance and publish them in a monthly paper. Being one of the few native English speakers with an interest in editing and journalism, I was selected to run the paper as Chief Editor.

I'm very proud of the results, you can find the finished version of the April edition [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vicfm15cza2gt8u/RUIS-April.pdf?dl=0). I wrote a couple articles, about the [federal funds hike](/2017/04/16/2017-05-01-federal-funds-hike/) and [IEX](/2017/04/16/2017-05-01-iex-s-crumbling-quote/). I also wrote a lovely editors note, available in the full edition.

We intend to release at least a few more editions before we all graduate, and we'll see how they turn out.
