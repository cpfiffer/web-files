The second week of math camp has been finished up. This week, we got into the nuts and bolts of matrices, eigenvalue decompositions, and a couple other linear algebra-type things. I will say, I did not think that I would be spending so much time doing homework -- everyone I knew said something along the lines of "only two hours a day? Sounds easy."

Turns out, I have spent at least 4+ hours a day on miscellaneous math homework. I've also been working on tutorials and documentation for the [Turing.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Turing.jl) project, so I've had little free time as of late. Still, being busy like this has been extremely rewarding.

I have also been trying to cram in about 30-60 minutes a night of reading [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732), a book recommended by some of the smart folks at Turing. Spectacularly reading, especially for those of us who come from the frequentist persuasion.
