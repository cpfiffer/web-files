I recently moved my site away from [zeit](zeit.co), and migrated it to [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com). It's much easier to maintain the site with git than with zeit's `now` feature, which is a little too high-powered for my tases.

I've also changed the theme to a modified version of [paperback](https://github.com/damiencaselli/paperback). The colors were originally all sepia tone, and I liked the current color scheme and typography.
