My last name tends to throw a lot of people off, because it has far too many f's and not enough real letters. While doing a bit of research on how to tell people how to best pronounce my name (it's "fye-fur", not "fiffer"), I found a [neat little poem](http://ncf.idallen.com/english.html) designed to showcase some of the strange ways English pronounces words. I sent it out to a couple of my friends from Norway and Greece and they politely declined to try a live reading. I can see why; I messed up about 15-20 words while reading it aloud.

Here's an excerpt:

>Compare alien with Italian,
>Dandelion and battalion.
>Sally with ally, yea, ye,
>Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, and key.
>Say aver, but ever, fever,
>Neither, leisure, skein, deceiver.
>Heron, granary, canary.
>Crevice and device and aerie.
>
>Face, but preface, not efface.
>Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.
>Large, but target, gin, give, verging,
>Ought, out, joust and scour, scourging.
>Ear, but earn and wear and tear
>Do not rhyme with here but ere.
>Seven is right, but so is even,
>Hyphen, roughen, nephew Stephen,
>Monkey, donkey, Turk and jerk,
>Ask, grasp, wasp, and cork and work.

Give it a shot, and see how well you can do with the whole poem. It's certainly fun to do.
