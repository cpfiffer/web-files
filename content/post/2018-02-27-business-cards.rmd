A couple months ago while I was bumming around London trying to get people to give me work, I made some (I think) really cool business card designs. I made a couple of different card designs that shared the same front and had varying backs. I have gotten some pretty good feedback whenever I've given these out.

All the designs are made by me in Adobe Illustrator. You can get similar cards made at [moo.com](moo.com).

### Front
`r tufte::margin_note("Boilerplate front matter.")`
![](/cards/front.jpg){height=300px}

### Accounting
`r tufte::margin_note("A graphical representation of the accounting identity. This might be my least favorite design.")`
![](/cards/accounting.jpg){height=300px}

### Capital Structure
`r tufte::margin_note("A pie chart showing the way that companies can be financed, along with the [weighted average cost of capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_average_cost_of_capital) function.")`
![](/cards/cap.jpg){height=300px}

### Event Study
`r tufte::margin_note("A visual depiction of how event studies are conducted in finance and economics.")`
![](/cards/event.jpg){width=100%}

### Gradient Descent (Type 1)
`r tufte::margin_note("The first style of gradient descent I designed. I did not use this one in my actual cards in favor of the next version.")`
![](/cards/graph1.jpg){height=300px}

### Gradient Descent (Type 2)
`r tufte::margin_note("This one is by far the most popular one I have made, and my personal favorite. It's a representation of 3d [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), a optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning.")`
![](/cards/graph2.jpg){height=300px}

### Markowitz Portfolio
`r tufte::margin_note("The Markowitz [mean-variance portfolio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).")`
![](/cards/markowitz.jpg){height=300px}

### Neural Network
`r tufte::margin_note("A representation of a small neural net. In retrospect, this design is a bit cluttered and unpleasant, and I'm often reluctant to give it out.")`
![](/cards/nn.jpg){height=300px}

### Options
`r tufte::margin_note("This is a short [butterfly option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_(options)), shown with all the constituent options.")`
![](/cards/options.jpg){width=100%}

### Regression
`r tufte::margin_note("Linear regression. Nice, clean, and simple")`
![](/cards/regression.jpg){height=300px}

### The Time Value of Money
`r tufte::margin_note("A fundamental part of finance and economics. I really like the way this one looks.")`
![](/cards/tvm.jpg){height=300px}

If you'd like a business card, send me an email at [cameron@pfiffer.org](mailto:cameron@pfiffer.org) and maybe I'll mail you one. They're pretty cool.
