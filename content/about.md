__I'm looking for work! If you need a financial analyst, data scientist, or just a quick learner, you can contact me at [cpfiffer@gmail.com](mailto:cpfiffer@gmail.com).__

I'm a graduate student in finance. I also play with code, and occasionally piano. This is a little website I built, partly as a portfolio of some of the stuff I can do, but also because it's fun.

I have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/) (which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)[^1]) Nominally, my degree is in corporate finance, though I've studied most business disciplines. I tend to use a lot of programming to handle the challenges in finance, and over time I'll populate this blog with some posts showcasing some of my best work.

[^1]: Yes, this is confusing, and it makes typing up resumes very difficult.
[^2]: I say Matlab, but most of my experience has been with the GNU version called [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). The syntax and functions are pretty much identical, with only minor changes required to adapt.
