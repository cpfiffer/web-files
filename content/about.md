I play with [code](https://www.github.com/cpfiffer) and [pianos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcsdFvTCGyJ8vSp3iHuTyg?view_as=subscriber).

I am a PhD student at the [University of Oregon](https://business.uoregon.edu/phd/concentrations/finance) studying finance. I have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/) (which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)), and a BSc in Technical Theater from [Southern Oregon University](https://sou.edu/). I'm a developer for [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml), a probabilistic programming tool.

My interests are pretty broad in finance, but in general I tend to favor situations where technology is involed (with some classic asset pricing stuff too):

* Market microstructure
* Cryptocurrency
* AI in financial markets
* Dynamic asset pricing

More computer science/statistics interests:

* Probabilistic programming
* Bayesian methods for big data
* Reinforcement learning

Favorite programming languages:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fast and fun to write!
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) because someone told me I should learn C and I thought this was cooler.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) because I am a masochist.
* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) because I forget how to take derivatives.

I do however flit between interests like a pixie, so this list is likely not current by the time you are reading it.
