{{% marginnote "mn-example" %}}It's me!{{% /marginnote%}}

I'm a graduate student in finance. I also play with [code](https://www.github.com/cpfiffer) and pianos.

I have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/) (which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)). Come fall, I will be a PhD student at the [University of Oregon](https://business.uoregon.edu/phd/concentrations/finance) studying finance.

My interests are pretty broad in finance, but in general I tend to favor situations where technology is involed:

* Exchanges
* Automated market makers
* Algorithmic trading
* High-frequency trading
* Cryptocurrencies
* AI in financial markets
* Anomaly detection

Outside of finance, I've been spending time in the following:

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory)
* This website and its nightmarish margin notes

I do however flit between interests like a pixie, so this list is likely not current by the time you are reading it.
