I play with [code](https://www.github.com/cpfiffer) and [pianos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcsdFvTCGyJ8vSp3iHuTyg?view_as=subscriber).

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Stanford's GSB](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/). I work on industrial organization with [Shoshana Vasserman](https://shoshanavasserman.com/). I received my PhD in finance from the [University of Oregon](https://business.uoregon.edu/phd/concentrations/finance). I have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/) (which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)), and a BSc in Technical Theater from [Southern Oregon University](https://sou.edu/). I'm often a developer for [Turing.jl](https://turing.ml), a probabilistic programming tool.

My interests are broad, but I tend to focus on technical topics. I am interested in:

* Industrial organization
* Asset pricing
* Bayesian statistics

Favorite programming languages:

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) because it's fast and fun to write!
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) because someone told me I should learn C and I thought this was cooler.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) because I am a masochist.
* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) because I forget how to take derivatives.

I do however flit between interests like a pixie, so this list is likely not current by the time you are reading it.
