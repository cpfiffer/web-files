# Notes on Order Cancellation

## Subrahmanyam, Zeng (2016)

### Notes

* HFT firms do not cancel orders more frequently than others, when you look at the top 50 price levels.
* Uses 116 stocks on NASDAQ during Q1 2011.
* HFT dominates cancellations at the top three price levels. Order executions are similar between HFT and non-HFT at approximately 50 price levels.
* Median order rest time:

| HFT     | 0.53      | 2.15    | 6.84      |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | --------- |
| Non-HFT | 3.02      | 3.47    | 4.48      |
|         | Large Cap | Mid Cap | Small Cap |

* HFT firms strategically place liquidity farther from the top of the book ahead of volatility.
* Liquidity provision is about balancing opportunity costs and adverse selection.

### Hypotheses

 	1. We should expect that cancellations should be more informative when performed by HFT firms.
 	2. Cancellations should be more informative at the top of the book.

### Questions

1. How does each level of the orderbook impact cancellation informativeness?

## Baldauf & Mollner (2018)

* Order anticipation by HFT firms reduces the rents that an informed trader can take $\implies$ reduced incentives to generate information.
* Higher speed, lower spreads and research intensity.
* The authors propose delaying non-cancellation orders and frequent batch auctions.
* They predict that frequent batch auctions improve cross-exchange coordination.

### Hypotheses

NA

### Questions
