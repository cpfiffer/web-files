      <description>A paper came out in the April 2017 edition of the Journal of Finance that I found to be absolutely fascinating. Normally I’d just put a link up on Twitter and move on, but leaving Facebook and Twitter have limited my ability to scream about cool papers. I thought I’d do a brief post about the paper and talk about why it’s interesting to me.
The abstract:
 We study intraday market intermediation in an electronic market before and during a period of large and temporary selling pressure.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m wrapping up my master&amp;rsquo;s degree, I have somehow managed to find a large amount of time to pursue personal interests. One of those interests is Julia, a technical computing language with C-comparable speed. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure where I stumbled on it, but it stuck with me. Of course, the best way to learn something is to do something cool with it, and FiveThiryEight&amp;rsquo;s Riddler often tends to supply great cannon fodder for programming.</description>

      <description>I recently moved my site away from zeit, and migrated it to GitHub Pages. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to maintain the site with git than with zeit&amp;rsquo;s now feature, which is a little too high-powered for my tases.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also changed the theme to a modified version of paperback. The colors were originally all sepia tone, and I liked the current color scheme and typography.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished building this site with Hugo and blogdown, an excellent R package built up by the folks at RStudio. The first iteration of this site is being hosted by zeit, a super interesting cloud company. Deployment takes about a minute, unlike the absolute nightmare that is Google Cloud. They take Dockerfiles as well, something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any experience with until lately.
As this is the first blog post here, I just thought I&amp;rsquo;d lay out a bit of why I built this.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8853; 
&amp;#8853; It&amp;rsquo;s me!
I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student in finance. I also play with code and pianos.
I am a PhD student at the University of Oregon studying finance. I have a master&amp;rsquo;s in finance from the ICMA Centre at the Henley Business School (which itself is part of the University of Reading), and a BSc in Technical Theater from Southern Oregon University.
My interests are pretty broad in finance, but in general I tend to favor situations where technology is involed:</description>
