<h1> 2018 Retrospective </h1>





<section>

<p>It&rsquo;s a new year, and I&rsquo;ve gathered some notes from the year gone by.</p>

<h1 id="achievements">Achievements</h1>

<ul>
<li>Became a C# software developer.</li>
<li>Went to Miami.</li>
<li>Passed CFA Level One.</li>
<li>Learned <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, got better at <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a>, introduced myself to <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, and <a href="https://chapel-lang.org/">Chapel</a>.</li>
<li>Started a <a href="https://business.uoregon.edu/faculty/cameron-pfiffer">PhD</a>.</li>
<li>Visited my grandmother in upstate New York with my brother.</li>
<li>Built and designed a tool to detect outlier performance in investment activities.</li>
<li>Endured a lot of Southern Oregon&rsquo;s wildfire smoke.</li>
<li>Moved from Medford, OR to Eugene, OR.</li>
<li>Finally got a piano in the house again. It is super out of tune so I&rsquo;ve mostly been playing honky tonk blues and stuff.</li>
<li>Started working on <a href="http://turing.ml/">Turing</a>.</li>
<li>Drilled through a bunch of 220v electrical lines.</li>
<li>Attended the Pacific Northwest Finance Conference in Seattle.</li>
<li>Had my first ever office hours.</li>
<li>Rowed 5km in 23:03.</li>
<li>Deadlifted 220lbs.</li>
<li>Made it through the first academic term with some pretty good grades. Courses taken so far are:

<ul>
<li>Math Camp</li>
<li>Core Microeconomics 1 (Consumer theory, mostly)</li>
<li>Econometrics 1 (Mathematical statistics)</li>
<li>Accounting Theory and Disclosure (disclosure theory, what accounting does, etc.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not insane yet.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>

<ul>
<li>Learn more about market microstructure. It&rsquo;s a fascinating field and nobody is going to tell me everything I want to know, so I have to make an effort to do so myself.</li>
<li>Keep up my programming skills. Don&rsquo;t get stale.</li>
<li>Really get better at understanding the nuance of MCMC methods. There&rsquo;s a lot of beauty there that needs to be unpacked.</li>
<li>Row a 5km in 22:30.</li>
<li>Save up enough to purchase a desktop computer.</li>
<li>Be better about remembering stuff.</li>
<li>Write at least one post a month.</li>
<li>Read academic papers more deliberately. Keep better summaries and focus on what matters.</li>
<li>Broaden my repertoire of left-hand licks (grooves? base lines? I have no idea) to include things requiring greater hand independence.</li>
<li>Do great in all my coursework.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bullets">Bullets</h1>

<p>I do a type of pseudo-bullet journaling, where I write down a couple of points from various days. Here are some of my favorites. I tend to swear a lot on in my journal, so I have censored them in accordance with the fact that I&rsquo;m sort of a professional adult.</p>

<ul>
<li>January 11th - &ldquo;C# isn&rsquo;t a terrible language.&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 14th - &ldquo;Had brownies for lunch and breakfast.&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 15th - &ldquo;steroid injections hurt&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 21st - &ldquo;Flying is stupid and I hate it.&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 23rd - &ldquo;Passed CFA level one, which means I have to keep going. ****.&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 26th - &ldquo;Being paid money is nice.&rdquo;</li>
<li>January 28th - &ldquo;I want to make a cryptocurrency exchange where the rules change every day. That&rsquo;d be fun.&rdquo;</li>
<li>February 3rd - &ldquo;Liz made some bomb-ass chili for dinner.&rdquo;</li>
<li>February 17th - &ldquo;Tried to refinance the car, failed dramatically.&rdquo;</li>
<li>February 20th - &ldquo;Bricked my Linux partition after trying to remove Python 2. Time for bed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>March 8th - &ldquo;Seems nobody has tried to break into the house yet.&rdquo;</li>
<li>March 20th - &ldquo;Another day, another step towards an inevitable death.&rdquo; Hilariously, this is immediately followed with &ldquo;Nothing interesting happened today.&rdquo;</li>
<li>March 27th - &ldquo;Worked on code all day. It was nice.&rdquo;</li>
<li>May 24th - &ldquo;Made Assist reading time go from 13 minutes to 30 seconds.&rdquo; The assist is a giant CSV parser we used at work, for background on this.</li>
<li>June 10th - &ldquo;Filled the pond with vinegar.&rdquo;</li>
<li>July 12th - &ldquo;Biked in $104^âˆ˜$ weather. It was OK.&rdquo;</li>
<li>August 10th - &ldquo;Made fancy mac + cheese.&rdquo;</li>
<li>August 24th - &ldquo;I am officially unemployed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>September 11th - &ldquo;I hate bus people. I should take my bike more.&rdquo; This didn&rsquo;t happen much. I live 12 miles one-way from school, and it&rsquo;s about two hours of biking a day to commute that way. I have done this kind of thing in the past and it is not great. Good way to lose 80 pounds, though.</li>
<li>September 14th - &ldquo;I made lava cake. Lava cake is <em>dope</em>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>September 27th - &ldquo;While putting up a pot rack, we hit an electrical line.&rdquo;</li>
<li>October 11th - &ldquo;Drank beer and worked on data structures.&rdquo; I am unclear about what this means.</li>
<li>November 18th - &ldquo;Drilled through <strong>another</strong> electrical cable in the wall, this time for the dryer. **** everything.&rdquo; Hilariously, this was a second attempt to install the pot rack introduced on September 27th.</li>
<li>December 9th - &ldquo;The mice in the ceiling continue to be spectacularly annoying.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
