			 	<h1>Economics Isn&#39;t Quantum</h1>
			  <span class="post-date">Wed, Jan 10, 2018</span>
			      <p>David Orrell <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/has-the-time-come-for-a-quantum-revolution-in-economics">wrote an article</a> for Aeon about how economics should essentially switch to a quantum perspective, where money is treated as the fundamental building block for systemic models of the economy. I do agree with some of his arguments, namely, that economics can be dated and mathematically rigid, but Orrell makes many other points that I do not believe to be accurate. I have cut out a couple of the quotes I really didn’t like.</p>
<p>Man, what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But something doesn’t add up about these responses. For one thing, if economics is about solving scarcity and making people happy by optimising prices, then it appears to be doing a rather poor job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economics is not the study of solving problems. It is the study of describing them as best as is possible. It is not about making people happy, necessarily. Nobody would accuse economists of bringing happiness to the world. It is about how people make choices under circumstances that restrict their options. Economists have many tools they use to simplify the math of determining what happiness is, such as utility, an abstraction of joy that many find distasteful. I am not the biggest fan of the concept of utility, but it is the best available option – happiness is difficult to measure quantitatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even stranger, though, is that in answering these basic questions money hardly seems to be mentioned – despite the fact that one would think money is at the heart of the subject. (Isn’t economics about money? Aren’t prices set by using money?) If you look at those textbooks, you will find that, while money is used as a metric, and there is some discussion of basic monetary plumbing, money is not considered an important subject in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economists do study money, either tangentially as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then there is the mass of complex financial derivatives, whose nominal value was estimated in 2010 at $1.2 quadrillion, but which is nowhere to be found in conventional models, even though it was at the root of the crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most economists ignore the debate and treat money as an inert medium of exchange with no special properties of its own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beacause it’s not they’re specialty! They are working on some other thing that relies upon the foundations that monetary economists study, while they work on game theory or whatever. That’s how all science works. If I were a biologist, I would use the best theories about vascular systems if I were working on a genetic problem, because it is only tangential to my current research interests and outside my scope of expertise.</p>
