Well, I'm taking the CFA Level 1 exam in a couple of hours. It has been an extraordinarily unpleasant experience, which is partially why it has been so long since I wrote a post. I also have been working full time, meaning a lot less time for idle fancy like programming and suchlike. 

Hopefully it all shakes out well, and I will be one year down into a painful rabbit hole of study that may continue for many more.
