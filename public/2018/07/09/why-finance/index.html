<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This coming fall, I will be a doctoral student at the University of Oregon. I wanted to get whatever thoughts I could ahead of my time there &ndash; to try and make a &ldquo;before and after&rdquo;. What will I think is interesting now, and what will I think is interesting when (or if) I graduate? Will I have achieved whatever goals I thought I wanted to?</p>

<p>To that end, I&rsquo;ve collected some of my thoughts on finance, why I personally like it, and what I&rsquo;m going to do after I graduate.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-finance">What is finance?</h2>

<p>For posterity, here is my definition of finance:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Finance is a social science concerned with how and when people move, use, and consume financial assets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finance is a <em>social science</em> because finance would not exist without people. There would be nothing to pay for twinkies with, <label for="twinkie" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="twinkie" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">And no twinkies for that matter.</span>
 no stocks to buy or sell, no bonds from sketchy south American countries.</p>

<p>It is concerned wth <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> because those are both critical components of a dynamic system. How a system works is a nontrivial factor in why anyone interacts with a financial markets. Financial markets that are complex and unpleasant to use don&rsquo;t find many participants <label for="participants" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="participants" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">Complex financial markets also generate middlemen and arbitrage opportunities.</span>
. That <em>why</em> is important because finance is ultimately concerned with the timing, magnitude, and nature of financial market activity from humans, and humans do not make choices in a vacuum. They make choices when confronted with circumstance and context.</p>

<p>The financial activities that economic actors can take impact the entire system. For example, an elderly couple entering retirement has hopefully assembled a pool of assets they can rely upon for the rest of their lives. Over several decades, they will convert stocks and bonds to cash to meet liquidity needs using the financial markets. Selling those securities has a ripple effect throughout the market, though for most couples the selling of any single couple is unlikely to cause much change in the aggregate. But on this small scale there are numerous other entities who are impacted by those transactions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Brokers who negotiate the trades.</li>
<li>Banks who might make markets in the sold securities.</li>
<li>Clearinghouses who clear and settle the trades.</li>
<li>Mutual funds, hedge funds, index funds, arbitrageurs, and speculators who might make decisions based on observed activity.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finance is the study of the network of entities who exchange assets with one another. Neat stuff.</p>

<h2 id="why-finance">Why finance?</h2>

<p>So why is finance something I&rsquo;m into? My background would not indicate to anyone that finance is a lifelong passion of mine. I have a Bachelors of Science in Theater Arts. Not exactly finance.</p>

<p>I had been exposed to some interesting stuff during my MSc in Finance. The first thing to pique my interest was algorithmic trading, which is the study of how to trade in an algorithmic fashion so as to meet some requirement, such as limited market impact or limited cost uncertainty. This is a heavily automated process. People can perform algorithmic trading without computers, but it is a slow and unplesant process.</p>

<p>More broadly I came to notice a lot more of the curious ways in which technological systems impact financial markets. <label for="trades" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="trades" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">This isn&rsquo;t even counting the number of orders placed and revoked, which is orders of magnitudes greater.</span>
Exchanges are heavily optimized for a tremendous amount of transactions. NASDAQ alone handled around <a href="http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=DailyMarketSummary">11.5 million trades</a> on July 12th, 2018.</p>

<p>High frequency traders use incredibly sophisticated software and hardware <label for="fpga" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="fpga" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="marginnote">My favorite thing among the HFT tricks is <a href="https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/10519/how-are-hft-systems-implemented-on-fpga-nowadays">the use of FPGAs</a>.</span>
 to gain microseconds on their competitors. There&rsquo;s some evidence to suggest that much of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; liqudity provided today comes from high frequency traders.</p>

<p>What about cryptocurrencies? Many financial economists I have spoken with are somewhere between dismissive and uninterested. But to me they appear to be the perfect distillation of my interests &ndash; sophisticated technological underpinnings, financial assets, and informational egalitarianism.</p>

<p>I am interested in finance because it is interesting. We all have money, sometimes however little, and we all use it. But more importantly, we are still in the midst of what may be the largest change in financial markets since fiat money. We are still trying to figure out how computational power can effect financial markets.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-going-to-do-after-you-graduate">What are you going to do after you graduate?</h2>

<p>I think it is too soon to say what I might like to do. Certainly there is a gravitation to the timescale and scope of an early academic career, but there&rsquo;s also an engineer in me &ndash; I like building things. I like functional programming, and systems rogramming, and data science. I think it&rsquo;s just a question of what everything will look like in five years.</p>
