    From Susan Athey&rsquo;s luncheon address on machine learning to the AFA:
 &hellip; and so we have to then develop on top of that best practices for analyzing a black box algorithm. And there&rsquo;s not really like a science and convention on that. If somebody writes a difference-in-difference paper, there&rsquo;s ten things you should do &ndash; There are best practices, and we know how to evaluate whether you should believe the results or not.

    <p>
    It&rsquo;s a new year, and I&rsquo;ve gathered some notes from the year gone by.
Achievements  Became a C# software developer. Went to Miami. Passed CFA Level One. Learned Rust, got better at Julia, introduced myself to OCaml, Haskell, and Chapel. Started a PhD. Visited my grandmother in upstate New York with my brother. Built and designed a tool to detect outlier performance in investment activities. Endured a lot of Southern Oregon&rsquo;s wildfire smoke.

I&rsquo;m always interested in seeing more people apply natural language processing to financial statements and headlines. A lot of the accounting literature where those kinds of tools are most likely to be useful uses very primitive techniques for textual analysis.
So I was delighted to read this paper by Marcelo and Manandhar on arXiv where the authors gather headlines and attempt volatility forecasting.

    &#8853; Patel, Yagna, 2018, Optimizing Market Making using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, arXiv:1812.10252 [cs, q-fin, stat].
Apparently I&rsquo;ve been on a kick reading some of these reinforcement learning/market making papers. Yagna Patel published an interesting paper on arXiv1 discussing the application of a reinforcement learning agent to market making, one of my favorite topics. Market making, that is, not necessarily reinforcement learning.
Why As Patel points out, there&rsquo;s three big concerns that users of machine learning in finance have to watch out for.

    <p>
    The second week of math camp has been finished up. This week, we got into the nuts and bolts of matrices, eigenvalue decompositions, and a couple other linear algebra-type things. I will say, I did not think that I would be spending so much time doing homework &ndash; everyone I knew said something along the lines of &ldquo;only two hours a day? Sounds easy.&rdquo;
Turns out, I have spent at least 4+ hours a day on miscellaneous math homework.

    At the University of Oregon, all the economist and economist-light &#8853; Here, &ldquo;economist-light&rdquo; just means all the business school disciplines; finance, marketing, accounting, etc.  folks take a three week math camp designed to get them up to speed on everything they could ever possibly hope to know about the mathematics used in economics.
Math camp started on Wednesday, August 29th, and so far I have had three math camp sessions which have shown me how little I know about absolutely anything.

    Via arXiv:
 We develop a large-scale deep learning model to predict price movements from limit order book (LOB) data of cash equities. The architecture utilises convolutional filters to capture the spatial structure of the limit order books as well as LSTM modules to capture longer time dependencies. The model is trained using electronic market quotes from the London Stock Exchange. Our model delivers a remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy for a variety of instruments and outperforms existing methods such as Support Vector Machines, standard Multilayer Perceptrons, as well as other previously proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures.

    <p>
    Introduction This coming fall, I will be a doctoral student at the University of Oregon. I wanted to get whatever thoughts I could ahead of my time there &ndash; to try and make a &ldquo;before and after&rdquo;. What will I think is interesting now, and what will I think is interesting when (or if) I graduate? Will I have achieved whatever goals I thought I wanted to?
To that end, I&rsquo;ve collected some of my thoughts on finance, why I personally like it, and what I&rsquo;m going to do after I graduate.

    &#8853; An Introduction to Information Theory by John R. Pierce. 
I&rsquo;ve recently been perusing an introductory text of information theory. Information theory is one of those things that I have always wanted to look into but never gotten around to &ndash; but now I am an adult with real things to try not to do, so I figured what the hell.
Information theory is the scientific study of how information can be quantified, stored, and communicated efficiently.

    <p>
    Via Gary Marcus:
 Thus, for example, in a system like Lerer et al’s (2016) efforts to learn about the physics of falling towers, there is no prior knowledge of physics (beyond what is implied in convolution). Newton’s laws, for example, are not explicitly encoded; the system instead (to some limited degree) approximates them by learning contingencies from raw, pixel level data. As I note in a forthcoming paper in innate (Marcus, in prep) researchers in deep learning appear to have a very strong bias against including prior knowledge even when (as in the case of physics) that prior knowledge is well known.

 Some people argue that those who have done nothing wrong need not worry. But that justifies limitless state surveillance, and risks a chilling effect on citizens’ fundamental civil liberties. After all, if you are not planning crimes while talking on the phone, why not just let police officers listen to every call? Police need oversight not because they are bad people but because maintaining the appropriate balance between liberty and security requires constant vigilance by engaged citizens.

    For the past two or so weeks I’ve been spending a lot of time writing Rust. Rust is a really spectacularly designed language with perhaps the greatest package manager⊕It’s called Cargo. I have ever experienced.
Rust is fascinating to me because it’s one of my first true compiled languages. In contrast to the other languages I’m somewhat good at:
 R (mostly interpereted) Python (interpereted) C# (JIT compiled) Julia (JIT compiled)  I am only passingly familiar with C and have mostly repressed C++, so Rust was both new and refreshing to me.

    From Martin Parker at the Guardian:
 We can see how this works if we look a bit more closely at the business-school curriculum and how it is taught. Take finance, for instance. This is a field concerned with understanding how people with money invest it. It assumes that there are people with money or capital that can be used as security for money, and hence it also assumes substantial inequalities of income and wealth.

    <p>
    An excellent article from the Atlantic explores the way that computational essays haven&rsquo;t seemed to penetrate academia. There&rsquo;s some information about the contest between open source and for-profit tools, like this:
 But it’s hard to sell the scientific community on a piece of commercial software. Even though Wolfram Research has given away a free Mathematica notebook viewer for years, and even though most major universities already have a site license that lets their students and faculty use Mathematica freely, it might be too much to ask publishers to abandon PDFs, an open format, for a proprietary product.

    <p>
    A couple months ago while I was bumming around London trying to get people to give me work, I made some (I think) really cool business card designs. I made a couple of different card designs that shared the same front and had varying backs. I have gotten some pretty good feedback whenever I’ve given these out.
All the designs are made by me in Adobe Illustrator. You can get similar cards made at moo.

    This strikes me as a strange use of corporate cash.
 Thirty US companies together have more than $800bn of fixed-income investments, according to a Financial Times analysis of their most recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
 That’s a lot of money. You might be wondering who those thirty companies are, and it’s probably who you’d expect – tech companies with far too much cash sitting around collecting dust.

    <p>
    Edmund Phelps writing at Project Syndicate:
 What made the American Dream distinctive was neither the hope of winning the lottery nor of being buoyed by national market forces or public policy. It was the hope of achieving things, with all that that entails: drawing on one’s personal knowledge, trusting one’s intuition, venturing into the unknown. It reflected the deep need of these Americans to have the experience of succeeding at something: a craftsman’s gratification at seeing his mastery result in better work, or a merchant’s satisfaction at seeing “his ship come in.

    A paper came out in the April 2017 edition of the Journal of Finance that I found to be absolutely fascinating. Normally I’d just put a link up on Twitter and move on, but leaving Facebook and Twitter have limited my ability to scream about cool papers. I thought I’d do a brief post about the paper and talk about why it’s interesting to me.
The abstract:
 We study intraday market intermediation in an electronic market before and during a period of large and temporary selling pressure.

    My last name tends to throw a lot of people off, because it has far too many f&rsquo;s and not enough real letters. While doing a bit of research on how to tell people how to best pronounce my name (it&rsquo;s &ldquo;fye-fur&rdquo;, not &ldquo;fiffer&rdquo;), I found a neat little poem designed to showcase some of the strange ways English pronounces words. I sent it out to a couple of my friends from Norway and Greece and they politely declined to try a live reading.

    I just started reading a book called How to Prove It: A Structured Approach, a book all about writing and understanding proofs. My unconventional background in mathematics means that I have a fair bit of terror when it comes to proofs; they have often come up on more quantitative finance courses in a tangential manner, as the proofs are often unnessecary. The fact remains that I am terrified by them, and wanted to get over my fear of proofs.

My final summer course for the master&rsquo;s program was all about Energy Finance, taught by an econometrician1. Commensurate with the professor&rsquo;s experience, the final paper was along the same lines. We were allowed to choose between three different project options.

    As I&rsquo;m wrapping up my master&rsquo;s degree, I have somehow managed to find a large amount of time to pursue personal interests. One of those interests is Julia, a technical computing language with C-comparable speed. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure where I stumbled on it, but it stuck with me. Of course, the best way to learn something is to do something cool with it, and FiveThiryEight&rsquo;s Riddler often tends to supply great cannon fodder for programming.

Kaggle’s introductory competition is about predicting which passengers on the Titanic are going to survive using a handful of features, so let’s launch into mucking about. This post follows a “lab book” style and is quite scattered, as I develop ideas about what to do.

Modern finance is a constantly evolving field. In the 1970s after Black-Scholes published their seminal paper, derivatives in their current form (for primitive derivatives are found as far back as in ancient Sumerian culture) became common and ubiquitous. Approximately ten years later, we saw the rise of the first quantitative powerhouse Renaissance Technologies, a firm that to this day makes absurd profits.

    I recently moved my site away from zeit, and migrated it to GitHub Pages. It&rsquo;s much easier to maintain the site with git than with zeit&rsquo;s now feature, which is a little too high-powered for my tases.
I&rsquo;ve also changed the theme to a modified version of paperback. The colors were originally all sepia tone, and I liked the current color scheme and typography.

    I thought I’d do a little bit of analysis to showcase some credit risk analysis, using logistic regression. I’ve pulled this sample loan data from a DataCamp course on credit risk. It’s a cool class, you should check it out if you have time. In a later post, I will try this same analysis with a neural network to see if it has better predictive capabilities.
Here’s a look at the data.

    A couple of my friends here at the University of Reading came up with an excellent idea to start a financial newspaper. The concept was that the society1 would collect articles on investing and other things finance and publish them in a monthly paper. Being one of the few native English speakers with an interest in editing and journalism, I was selected to run the paper as Chief Editor.
I&rsquo;m very proud of the results, you can find the finished version of the April edition here.

    Hello! I&rsquo;ve just finished building this site with Hugo and blogdown, an excellent R package built up by the folks at RStudio. The first iteration of this site is being hosted by zeit, a super interesting cloud company. Deployment takes about a minute, unlike the absolute nightmare that is Google Cloud. They take Dockerfiles as well, something that I haven&rsquo;t had any experience with until lately.
As this is the first blog post here, I just thought I&rsquo;d lay out a bit of why I built this.

Last month, the Federal Reserve raised the short-term interest rate target range by 0.25%, to a range of 0.75% to 1%. This is in line with the central bank’s “slow and steady” approach to rate increases after a decade of historically low interest rates, and is the third such rate increase since June of 2006.

Their first innovation was to treat what is referred to as stale quote arbitrage.
