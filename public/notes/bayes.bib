Increases in producers' hedging demand or speculators' capital constraints increase hedging costs via price-pressure on futures. These in turn affect producers' equilibrium hedging and supply decision inducing a link between a financial friction in the futures market and the commodity spot prices. Consistent with the model, measures of producers' propensity to hedge forecasts futures returns and spot prices in oil and gas market data from 1979 to 2010. The component of the commodity futures risk premium associated with producer hedging demand rises when speculative activity reduces. We conclude that limits to financial arbitrage generate limits to hedging by producers, and affect equilibrium commodity supply and prices.},

While we find an increase in the adverse selection component of the bid-ask spread on the day of and the day prior to quarterly earnings announcements for firms with less predictable earnings, we find no evidence of such changes for firms with more predictable earnings. During a non-announcement period, we find that firms with relatively less predictable earnings have consistently higher total bid-ask spreads than firms with more predictable earnings. This finding suggests that firms with relatively less predictable earnings have a higher cost of equity capital than comparable firms with more predictable earning streams, ceteris paribus. Hence, earnings predictability may be a legitimate concern of managers who wish to minimize their cost of equity capital at least as it pertains to bid-ask spreads.},

  abstract = {Light clients, also known as Simple Payment Verification (SPV) clients, are nodes which only download a small portion of the data in a blockchain, and use indirect means to verify that a given chain is valid. Typically, instead of validating block data, they assume that the chain favoured by the blockchain's consensus algorithm only contains valid blocks, and that the majority of block producers are honest. By allowing such clients to receive fraud proofs generated by fully validating nodes that show that a block violates the protocol rules, and combining this with probabilistic sampling techniques to verify that all of the data in a block actually is available to be downloaded, we can eliminate the honest-majority assumption, and instead make much weaker assumptions about a minimum number of honest nodes that rebroadcast data. Fraud and data availability proofs are key to enabling on-chain scaling of blockchains (e.g. via sharding or bigger blocks) while maintaining a strong assurance that on-chain data is available and valid. We present, implement, and evaluate a novel fraud and data availability proof system.},

The crux of the analysis is the dependence of the bid-ask prices on the market-maker's stock inventory position. We derive the optimal policy and its characteristics and compare it to Garman's. The results are shown to be consistent with some conjectures and observed phenomena, like the existence of a `preferred' inventory position and the downward monotonicity of the bid-ask prices. For linear demand and supply functions we derive the behavior of the bid-ask spread and show that the transaction-to-transaction price behavior is intertemporally dependent. However, we prove that it is impossible to make a profit on this price dependence by trading against the market-maker. Thus, in this situation, serially dependent price-changes are consistent with the market efficiency hypothesis.},

Recent evidence suggests that there is a negatively correlated relationship between assets' liquidity and their expected returns. Firms can thereby benefit from policies that increase the liquidity of the claims they issue. However, enhancing the liquidity of traded assets entails nontrivial costs. The associated tradeoff is then examined and a number of commonly observed corporate financial policies and institutional arrangements are explained as liquidity-increasing investments.]},

The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time.},

We examine the effect of the MMF reform on banks' business models. We find that while banks were able to replace some of this lost funding, the primary response to the reform was a cutback in arbitrage positions that relied on unsecured funding, rather than a reduction in loan provision. In particular, we document that the reform significantly reduced the supply of unsecured arbitrage capital for two risk-free arbitrage strategies: the interest on excess reserves arbitrage and the covered interest rate parity arbitrage. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the reform on quarter-end window dressing, as well as the relationship between arbitrage capital and arbitrage profits.},

Passive investors appear to exert influence through their large voting blocs, and consistent with the observed governance differences increasing firm value, passive ownership is associated with improvements in firms' longer-term performance.},

These patterns are robust across barcodes, brands, and very heterogeneous types of products, and contrast with the increasing size of firms over their life cycle. To understand the mechanism behind the decline in product sales and reconcile these seemingly opposing dynamics in the product and firm life cycles, we structurally estimate a model of oligopolistic competition between heterogeneous multi-product firms. Our estimates indicate that the decline in sales of products results from decreases in their quality relative to other options available to consumers, including new products of the same firm. We show that firms must introduce new products to grow, otherwise their portfolio becomes obsolete as their rivals introduce new products of their own. By introducing new products, however, firms accelerate the decline in sales of their own existing products.},

We then describe new types of questions that have been posed surrounding the application of machine learning to policy problems, including ``prediction policy problems,'' as well as considerations of fairness and manipulability. We present some highlights from the emerging econometric literature combining machine learning and causal inference. Finally, we overview a set of broader predictions about the future impact of machine learning on economics, including its impacts on the nature of collaboration, funding, research tools, and research questions.},

We also analyze competition by commercial firms with OSS projects. Optimal pricing policies again vary: in some cases the commercial firm will set low prices when the open-source project is small; in other cases it mostly waits until the open-source project has matured.},

  abstract = {Critics argue that fair value provisions in U.S. accounting rules exacerbated the recent financial crisis by depleting banks' regulatory capital, which curtailed lending and triggered asset sales, leading to further economic turmoil. Defenders counter-argue that the fair value provisions were insufficient to lead to the pro-cyclical effects alleged by the critics. Our evidence indicates that these provisions did not affect the commercial banking industry in the ways commonly alleged by critics. First, we show that fair value accounting losses had minimal effect on regulatory capital. Then, we examine sales of securities during the crisis, finding mixed evidence that banks sold securities in response to capital-depleting charges. However, the sales that potentially resulted from the charges appear to be economically insignificant, as there was no industry- or firm-level increase in sales of securities during the crisis.},

By some measures, payers tend to omit dividends when demand is low. Further analysis confirms that these results are better explained by catering than other theories of dividends.},

In the presence of short-sales constraints, high liquidity is a symptom of the fact that the market is dominated by these irrational investors, and hence is overvalued. This theory can also explain how managers might successfully time the market for seasoned equity offerings, by simply following a rule of thumb that involves issuing when the SEO market is particularly liquid. Empirically, we find that: (i) aggregate measures of equity issuance and share turnover are highly correlated; yet (ii) in a multiple regression, both have incremental predictive power for future equal-weighted market returns.},

We show that codebases that are more modular or have more option value (1) increase developers' incentives to join and remain involved in an open source development effort and (2) decrease the amount of free riding in equilibrium. These effects occur because modularity and option value create opportunities for the exchange of valuable work among developers, opportunities that do not exist in codebases that are not modular or have no option value.},

These topics include investment strategies, securities issuance, marketing, financial constraints and liquidity, and new agreements. Most specifically, discretionary accruals explained by the MD\&A text are not associated with restatements and accounting litigation, whereas unexplained discretionary accruals do predict such misconduct.},

  abstract = {The average cash-to-assets ratio for U.S. industrial firms more than doubles from 1980 to 2006. A measure of the economic importance of this increase is that at the end of the sample period, the average firm can retire all debt obligations with its cash holdings. Cash ratios increase because firms' cash f lows become riskier. In addition, firms change: They hold fewer inventories and receivables and are increasingly R\&D intensive. While the precautionary motive for cash holdings plays an important role in explaining the increase in cash ratios, we find no consistent evidence that agency conf licts contribute to the increase.},

The classic setting is that uninformed dedicated liquidity suppliers charge price concessions when incoming market orders are likely to be informationally motivated. In limit order book (LOB) markets, however, this relationship is less clear, as market participants can switch roles, and freely choose to immediately demand or patiently supply liquidity by submitting either market or limit orders. We study the importance of information asymmetry in LOBs based on a recent sample of 30 German Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX) stocks. We find that Hasbrouck's (1991) measure of trade informativeness Granger causes book liquidity, in particular that required to fill large market orders. Picking-off risk due to public news-induced volatility is more important for top-of-the book liquidity supply. In our multivariate analysis, we control for volatility, trading volume, trading intensity and order imbalance to isolate the effect of trade informativeness on book liquidity.},

We find evidence of significant ICO underpricing, with average returns of 179\% from the ICO price to the first day's opening market price, over a holding period that averages just 16 days. Even after imputing returns of -100\% to ICOs that don't list their tokens within 60 days and adjusting for the returns of the asset class, the representative ICO investor earns 82\%. After trading begins, tokens continue to appreciate in price, generating average buy-andhold abnormal returns of 48\% in the first 30 trading days. We also study the determinants of ICO underpricing and relate cryptocurrency prices to Twitter followers and activity. While our results could be an indication of bubbles, they are also consistent with high compensation for risk for investing in unproven pre-revenue platforms through unregulated offerings.},

By considering these factors, this paper assesses the efficiency of trading halts by examining the return, volatility and volume behavior around news-initiated trading halts through the unique microstructure and trade-by-trade data of the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). It also investigates, for the first time, the trading behavior of different types of investors such as individuals, mutual funds and brokerage houses around trading halts.},

This study examines the performance of VPIN around inventory announcements and price jumps in crude oil and natural gas futures markets with a sample period from January 2009 to May 2015. We obtain several interesting results: (i) VPIN increases significantly around inventory announcements with price jumps as well as at jumps not associated with any scheduled announcements. (ii) VPIN does not peak prior to the events but shortly after. (iii) A minor variation of VPIN based on exponential smoothing significantly improves the early warning signal property of VPIN, and this estimate of toxicity returns faster to the pre-event level. \textcopyright{} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The effects of noise on the world, and on our views of the world, are profound. Noise in the sense of a large number of small events is often a causal factor much more powerful than a small number of large events can be. Noise makes trading in financial markets possible, and thus allows us to observe prices for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of inefficiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absence of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity. Most generally, noise makes it very difficult to test either practical or academic theories about the way that financial or economic markets work. We are forced to act largely in the dark.},

Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

Furthermore, few trades seem to be executed during cancel clusters or even immediately after them. Low cancellation activity seems to be markedly different with many level changes all be caused by executions. Our results are consistent with high frequency trading firms behaving as agents who bring efficiency to the market without the need to have executions at intermediate prices. We also discuss the misconception that investors and low frequency trader are synonymous and its implications for policy given our results.},

We do this in an experimental market setting that allows us to determine not only how noise traders fare in a competitive asset market with other traders, but also how the equilibrium changes if a securities transactions tax ("Tobin tax") is imposed. We find that noise traders lose money on average: they do not engage in extensive liquidity provision, and their attempt to make money by trend chasing is unsuccessful as they lose most in securities whose prices experience large moves. Noise traders adversely affect the informational efficiency of the market: they drive prices away from fundamental values, and the further away the market gets from the true value, the stronger this effect becomes. With a securities transaction tax, noise traders submit fewer orders and lose less money in those securities that exhibit large price movements. The tax is associated with a decrease in market trading volume, but informational efficiency remains essentially unchanged and liquidity (as measured by the price impact of trades) actually improves. We find no significant effect, however, on market volatility, suggesting that at least this rationale for a securities transaction tax is not supported by our data.},

Public capital markets provide liquidity, but stipulate corporate governance that imposes generic exogenous controls, so the manager may not attain the desired trade-off between autonomy and the cost of capital. In contrast, private ownership provides the desired trade-off through precisely calibrated contracting, but creates illiquid ownership. Exploring this tension generates new predictions.},

This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets.

Any joint venture involves both joint financial interest and control over the production levels of the venture entity and the parent firms. The competitive incentives of the parents and rival firms depend on the exact financial interest and control arrangements made. This paper analyzes a number of alternative arrangements within the standard non-cooperative oligopoly model and devises a Modified Herfindahl-Hirshman Index (MHHI) to quantify their relative competitive incentives. Independent entry by a single parent and a full merger of the parents may be viewed as particular financial interest and control arrangements. The use of this methodology for policy analysis of proposed ventures is illustrated with the facts of the recent GM-Toyota joint venture.},

Also compared, are spreads observed before and after trading was automated (and made anonymous) on commodity futures markets, and it is discovered that spreads have generally widened since trading was automated, and that they have an increased tendency to widen in periods of high volatility. These findings suggest that commodity futures markets have an inherently different character than financial futures markets, and therefore merit separate investigation.},

Many critics argue that the frequent trading and short-term focus of institutional investors encourages managers to engage in such myopic investment behavior. Others argue that the large stockholdings and sophistication of institutions allow managers to focus on long-term value rather than on short-term earnings. I examine these competing views by testing whether institutional ownership affects R\&D spending for firms that could reverse a decline in earnings with a reduction in R\&D. The results indicate that managers are less likely to cut R\&D to reverse an earnings decline when institutional ownership is high, implying that institutions are sophisticated investors who typically serve a monitoring role in reducing pressures for myopic behavior. However, I find that a large proportion of ownership by institutions that have high portfolio turnover and engage in momentum trading significantly increases the probability that managers reduce R\&D to reverse an earnings decline. These results indicate that high turnover and momentum trading by institutional investors encourages myopic investment behavior when such institutional investors have extremely high levels of ownership in a firm; otherwise, institutional ownership serves to reduce pressures on managers for myopic investment behavior.},

This token is first sold to investors via an auction (the ICO phase) and then traded on a frictionless financial market. I establish that seignorage is effective at providing capital and at generating incentives to develop the protocol. Its effectiveness is however limited by the fact that, in all equilibria of the game, in each post-ICO period there is a positive probability that the developer sells all his tokens and, as a consequence, no development occurs.},

In this paper we propose a new Bayesian estimation procedure for (possibly very large) VARs featuring time-varying volatilities and general priors. We show that indeed empirically the new estimation procedure performs well in applications to both structural analysis and out-of-sample forecasting.},

We show that the ICO mechanism allows entrepreneurs to generate buyer competition for the token, giving it value. We also find that venture returns are independent of any committed growth in the supply of tokens over time, but that initial funds raised are maximized by setting that growth to zero to encourage saving by early participants. Nonetheless, since the value of the tokens depends on a single period of demand, the ability to raise funds is more limited than in traditional equity finance. Furthermore, a lack of commitment in monetary policy undermines saving behavior, hence the cost of using tokens to fund start-up costs is inflexibility in future capital raises. Crypto tokens can also facilitate coordination among stakeholders within digital ecosystems when network effects are present.},

In this paper, we study the profitability of market making strategies in a variety of time series models for the evolution of a stock's price. We first provide a precise theoretical characterization of the profitability of a simple and natural market making algorithm in the absence of any stochastic assumptions on price evolution. This characterization exhibits a trade-off between the positive effect of local price fluctuations and the negative effect of net price change. We then use this general characterization to prove that market making is generally profitable on mean reverting time series \textemdash{}time series with a tendency to revert to a long-term average. Mean reversion has been empirically observed in many markets, especially foreign exchange and commodities. We show that the slightest mean reversion yields positive expected profit, and also obtain stronger profit guarantees for a canonical stochastic mean reverting process, known as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, as well as other stochastic mean reverting series studied in the finance literature. We also show that market making remains profitable in expectation for the OU process even if some realistic restrictions on trading frequency are placed on the market maker.},

We consider a firm that faces asymmetric information in both the product and financial markets and that needs to raise external financing to fund its growth opportunity (new project). Any product market advertising undertaken by the firm is visible to the financial market as well. In equilibrium, the firm uses a combination of product market advertising, equity underpricing, and underfinancing (raising a smaller amount of external capital than the full information optimum) to convey its true product quality and the intrinsic value of its projects to consumers and investors. The following two predictions arise from our theoretical analysis for the relation between product market advertising and equity underpricing around new equity issues. First, firms choose a higher level of product market advertising when they are planning to issue new equity, compared with situations in which they have no immediate plans to do so. Second, product market advertising and equity underpricing are substitutes for a firm issuing new equity. We empirically test the above two predictions and find supporting evidence in the context of firms making initial public offerings and seasoned equity offerings.},

This tracking behavior has powerful implications for their portfolio choice, and its information content. An institution that downloaded an insider-trading filing by a given firm last quarter increases its likelihood of downloading an insider-trading filing on the same firm by more than 41.3\% this quarter. Moreover, the average tracked stock that an institution buys generates annualized alphas of between 9-18\% relative to the purchase of an average nontracked stock. We find that institutional managers tend to track members of the top management teams of firms (CEOs, CFOs, Presidents, and Board Chairs), and tend to share educational and location-based commonalities with the specific insiders they choose to follow. Collectively, our results suggest that the information in tracked trades is important for fundamental firm value, and is only revealed following the information-rich dual trading by insiders and linked institutions.},

As a result of their greater ability to diversify idiosyncratic risk in the capital market, public firms' owners tolerate higher profit variability than owners of private firms. Consequently, public firms adopt riskier and more aggressive output market strategies than private firms, which improves the competitive position of the former vis-a -vis the latter. This strategic benefit of being public, and thus, the proportion of public firms in an industry, is shown to be positively related to the degree of competitive interaction among firms in the output market, to demand uncertainty, and to the idiosyncratic portion of this uncertainty. Additional empirical predictions concern the effect of a firm's initial public offering on its market share and on its rivals' valuations. We test the model's predictions and find empirical support for most of them.},

NTMs have demonstrated superior performance over Long Short-Term Memory Cells in several sequence learning tasks. A number of open source implementations of NTMs exist but are unstable during training and/or fail to replicate the reported performance of NTMs. This paper presents the details of our successful implementation of a NTM. Our implementation learns to solve three sequential learning tasks from the original NTM paper. We find that the choice of memory contents initialization scheme is crucial in successfully implementing a NTM. Networks with memory contents initialized to small constant values converge on average 2 times faster than the next best memory contents initialization scheme.},

We show that when informativeness is sufficiently high (low) volatility and informativeness positively (negatively) comove in equilibrium for any change in primitives.

We use data on U.S. stocks between 1963 and 2017 to recover stock-specific primitives and find that most stocks lie in the region of the parameter space in which informativeness and volatility comove negatively.},

Second, the models all generate tests of low power for earnings management of economically plausible magnitudes (e.g., one to five percent of total assets). Third, all models reject the null hypothesis of no earnings management at rates exceeding the specified test-levels when applied to samples of firms with extreme financial performance. This result highlights the importance of controlling for financial performance when investigating earnings management stimuli that are correlated with financial performance. Finally, a modified version of the model developed by Jones (1991) exhibits the most power in detecting earnings management.]},

In addition, we directly track entrepreneurs' efforts after fundraising activities using the post-ICO technological development. We find that while the three factors have the same positive effects, the team with strong influence, one subindicator of team quality, positively predicts ICO success but negatively correlates with development progress. These results suggest that ICO events are plausibly prone to coalitions of powerful players whose main objective is likely to be cashing out after ICO without pushing for the development of its purported project. Finally, we construct a token valuation measure and show that technological development and user base are two significant drivers of the token value.},

Previous theoretical work on disclosure of new information by firms has demonstrated that releasing public information will often make all shareholders worse off, due to an adverse risk-sharing effect. This paper uses a general equilibrium model with endogenous information collection to demonstrate that there exists a policy of disclosure of information which makes all shareholders better off than a policy of no disclosure. The welfare improvement occurs because of explicit information cost savings and improved risk sharing. This provides a positive theory of precommitment to disclosure, because it will be unanimously voted for by stockholders and will also represent the policy that will maximize value ex ante. In addition, it provides a ``missing link'' in financial signalling models. Apart from the effects on information production analyzed in this paper, most existing financial signalling models are inconsistent with a firm taking actions which facilitate future signalling because release of the signal makes all investors worse off.},

Instead, we use variations on the Nelson\textendash{}Siegel exponential components framework to model the entire yield curve, period-by-period, as a three-dimensional parameter evolving dynamically. We show that the three time-varying parameters may be interpreted as factors corresponding to level, slope and curvature, and that they may be estimated with high efficiency. We propose and estimate autoregressive models for the factors, and we show that our models are consistent with a variety of stylized facts regarding the yield curve. We use our models to produce term-structure forecasts at both short and long horizons, with encouraging results. In particular, our forecasts appear much more accurate at long horizons than various standard benchmark forecasts.},

Our results demonstrate the ability of the RNN to capture the non-linear relationship between the near-term price-flips and a spatio-temporal representation of the limit order book. The RNN compares favorably with other classifiers, including a linear Kalman filter, using S\&P500 E-mini futures level II data over the month of August 2016. Further results assess the effect of retraining the RNN daily and the sensitivity of the performance to trade latency.},

  abstract = {We propose a set of intuitive model-free measures of cross-market trading activity based on publicly available trade and quote data with sufficient time stamp granularity. By virtue of capturing the offset at which co-activity peaks, as well as its magnitude and dispersion, the measures allow us to shed new light on the distinct features of the high-frequency cross-market linkages in US Treasury and equity markets. First, the measures avoid reliance on noisy return series often used in the literature and demonstrate sharp identification of the prevailing lead-lag relationships between trading activity across markets. Second, we show how the measures can be used to examine price impact and liquidity provision in (near) arbitrage linked markets. In particular, we provide new evidence pointing to the fact that price discovery in US Treasury, equity and EUR/USD FX markets primarily takes place in futures rather than cash markets and we give a strong rationale for considering the cross-market price impact between arbitrage linked markets. Finally, we show that our measures of cross-market activity are closely linked with observed market volatility even after controlling for commonly used measures of individual market activity such as trading volume and number of transactions. Overall, our empirical findings suggest that accounting for cross-market trading activity is important when studying volatility and liquidity in US Treasury and equity markets.},

Modern electronic stock markets produce large volumes of data, which are very suitable for use with these algorithms. This research explores new scientific ground by designing and evaluating a convolutional neural network in predicting future financial outcomes. A visually inspired transformation process translates high-frequency market microstructure data from the London Stock Exchange into four market-event based input channels, which are used to train six deep networks. Primary results indicate that con-volutional networks behave reasonably well on this task and extract interesting microstructure patterns, which are in line with previous theoretical findings. Furthermore, it demonstrates a new approach using modern deep-learning techniques for exploiting and analysing market microstructure behaviour.},

Using ultra high-frequency data from the Nasdaq exchange, we perform empirical analysis on various limit order book events and propose novel ways for modelling some of these events, including cancellation of limit orders in various positions and size of market orders. Based on our empirical findings, we develop a queuing model that captures stylized facts on the data. This model includes a distinct feature which allows for a potentially random effect due to the agent's impulse control. We apply the queuing model in an algorithmic trading setting by considering an agent maximizing her expected utility through placing and cancelling of limit orders. The agent's optimal strategy is presented after calibrating the model to real data. A simulation study shows that for the same level of standard deviation of terminal wealth, the optimal strategy has a 2.5\% higher mean compared to a strategy which ignores the effect of position; or a 8.8\% lower standard deviation for the same level of mean. This extra gain stems from posting a limit order during adverse conditions and obtaining a good queue position before conditions become favourable.},

We build and solve a dynamic trading model, in which traders receive private information of asset value over time and trade strategically with demand schedules in a sequence of double auctions. A stationary linear equilibrium and its efficiency properties are characterized explicitly in closed form. Slow trading (few double auctions per unit of time) serves as a commitment device that induces aggressive demand schedules, but fast trading allows more immediate reaction to new information. If all traders have the same speed, the socially optimal trading frequency tends to be low for scheduled arrivals of information but high for stochastic arrivals of information. If traders have heterogeneous trading speeds, fast traders prefer the highest feasible trading frequency, whereas slow traders tend to prefer a strictly lower frequency.},

This paper examines the idea of modeling this distribution as a discrete mixture of normals. The flexibility of this class of distributions provides a transparent look into the tails of the returns distribution. Model diagnostics suggest that the model, SV-mix, does a good job of capturing the salient features of the data. In a direct comparison against several affine-jump models, SV-mix is strongly preferred by Akaike and Schwarz information criteria.},

We develop a framework to characterize the optimal two-sided pricing strategy of a platform firm; that is, the pricing strategy toward the direct users of the platform as well as toward firms offering applications that are complementary to the platform. We compare industry structures based on a proprietary platform (such as Windows) with those based on an open source platform (such as Linux), and analyze the structure of competition and industry implications in terms of pricing, sales, profitability, and social welfare. We find that, when the platform is proprietary, the equilibrium prices for the platform, the applications, and the platform access fee for applications may be below marginal cost, and we characterize demand conditions that lead to this. The proprietary applications sector of an industry based on an open source platform may be more profitable than the total profits of a proprietary platform industry. When users have a strong preference for application variety, the total profits of the proprietary industry are larger than the total profits of an industry based on an open source platform. The variety of applications is larger when the platform is open source. When a system based on an open source platform with an independent proprietary application competes with a proprietary system, the proprietary system is likely to dominate the open source platform industry both in terms of market share and profitability. This may explain the dominance of Microsoft in the market for PC operating systems.},

Inside debt is a superior solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses and salaries proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and equity is typically inefficient. In most cases, an equity bias is desired to induce effort. However, if effort is productive in increasing liquidation value, or if bankruptcy is likely, a debt bias can improve effort as well as alleviate the agency costs of debt. The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence.},

We provide here an empirical study of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their respective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data the "bare" impact these events would have, if they were to happen in isolation. For large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events is permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small tick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history dependent part, reflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this effect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model on the past order flow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three parts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of the different events, and the modification of the future gaps behind the best quotes. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact model that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when other types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to describe the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.},

VNET is constructed from the excess volume of buys or sells associated with a price movement. As this measure varies over time, it can be forecast and explained. Using NYSE TORQ data, it is found that market depth varies with volume, transactions, and volatility. These movements are interpreted in terms of the varying proportion of informed traders in an asymmetric information model. When an unbalanced order flow is transacted in a surprisingly short time relative to that expected using the Engle and Russell (Econometrica 66 (1998) 1127) ACD model, the depth is further reduced providing an estimate of the value of patience. The analysis is repeated for 1997 TAQ data revealing that the parameters of the relationships changed only modestly, despite shifts in market volume, volatility, and minimum tick size. A dynamic market reaction curve is estimated with the new data.},

  abstract = {A mathematical model is developed to provide a theoretical framework for a computer-oriented solution to the problem of recognizing those records in two files which represent identical persons, objects or events (said to be matched). A comparison is to be made between the recorded characteristics and values in two records (one from each file) and a decision made as to whether or not the members of the comparison-pair represent the same person or event, or whether there is insufficient evidence to justify either of these decisions at stipulated levels of error. These three decisions are referred to as link (A 1), a non-link (A 3), and a possible link (A 2). The first two decisions are called positive dispositions. The two types of error are defined as the error of the decision A 1 when the members of the comparison pair are in fact unmatched, and the error of the decision A 3 when the members of the comparison pair are, in fact matched. The probabilities of these errors are defined as    and    respectively where u({$\gamma$}), m({$\gamma$}) are the probabilities of realizing {$\gamma$} (a comparison vector whose components are the coded agreements and disagreements on each characteristic) for unmatched and matched record pairs respectively. The summation is over the whole comparison space r of possible realizations. A linkage rule assigns probabilities P(A 1|{$\gamma$}), and P(A 2|{$\gamma$}), and P(A 3|{$\gamma$}) to each possible realization of {$\gamma$} {$\epsilon$} {$\Gamma$}. An optimal linkage rule L ({$\mu$}, {$\lambda$}, {$\Gamma$}) is defined for each value of ({$\mu$}, {$\lambda$}) as the rule that minimizes P(A 2) at those error levels. In other words, for fixed levels of error, the rule minimizes the probability of failing to make positive dispositions. A theorem describing the construction and properties of the optimal linkage rule and two corollaries to the theorem which make it a practical working tool are given.},

Those anticipating price trends have impacts as if they are informed traders, while the case for anticipatory participants affecting the volume of other traders is rejected.

To identify anticipatory traders, we devise novel methods to isolate local price trends using order book data from the WTI crude oil futures market.},

We find no evidence that this over-time increase in the magnitude of the market reaction to our sample firms' earnings announcements is attributable to increases in the absolute amount of unexpected earnings conveyed in the announcements or to increases in the intensity of investors' average reaction to unexpected earnings. To test the third explanation-an over-time expansion in the amount of concurrent (with bottom line earnings) information in earnings announcement press releases-we analyze and code the contents of 2,190 earnings announcement press releases made by 30 of our sample firms over 1980-1999. Concurrent disclosures increased significantly over this period and we find that these concurrent disclosures, especially the inclusion of detailed income statements, explain increases in the absolute market reactions to earnings announcements for our sample firms.},

We provide explicit formulas for the measure of information that is coupled with any given measure of uncertainty and vice versa.

Using proprietary high frequency data on quotes by the largest foreign exchange dealer banks in the Dealer-to-Client market, we find a significant heterogeneity in their behavior. We develop a model of strategic competition that accounts for this heterogeneity and the two-tier market structure and allows us to link prices and bid-ask spreads in the D2C and D2D market segments. We use the model to recover dealers' risk aversions and inventories from their quotes in the D2C segment and construct an endogenous measure of systemic, non-diversifiable risk capturing the cross-sectional liquidity-risk mismatch. Consistent with the model predictions, we find that liquidity mismatch negatively predicts prices in the D2D market, while the cross-sectional dispersion in dealer risk aversions negatively predicts spreads in the D2D market.},

  abstract = {Policymakers have been working to stabilize distressed neighborhoods since the 2008--2010 foreclosure crisis. We show that profit-seeking institutional investors purchased distressed properties and aided the recovery of local housing markets. Using a quasi-natural experiment in which investors purchased pre-packaged home portfolios, we find that average properties located within 0.25 miles of bulk-sold properties sell for 1.4\% higher than homes located farther away. The spillover effect is greater for foreclosed homes (4.3\%), homes in highly distressed neighborhoods (7.4\%), and homes that are similar to the bulk-sold homes (2.5\%). Our results show that institutional investors provided valuable liquidity which helped recover depressed home values. Importantly, this recovery was primarily market-driven, which contrasts with the numerous government-sponsored initiatives to stabilize local neighborhoods.},

We additionally propose an investment strategy based on the conditional price reaction of each market that achieved a success rate of 70\% in an outof-sample study. Finally, we document the impact on volume and bid-ask spreads.},

  abstract = {A neural network (NN) is a parameterised function that can be tuned via gradient descent to approximate a labelled collection of data with high precision. A Gaussian process (GP), on the other hand, is a probabilistic model that defines a distribution over possible functions, and is updated in light of data via the rules of probabilistic inference. GPs are probabilistic, data-efficient and flexible, however they are also computationally intensive and thus limited in their applicability. We introduce a class of neural latent variable models which we call Neural Processes (NPs), combining the best of both worlds. Like GPs, NPs define distributions over functions, are capable of rapid adaptation to new observations, and can estimate the uncertainty in their predictions. Like NNs, NPs are computationally efficient during training and evaluation but also learn to adapt their priors to data. We demonstrate the performance of NPs on a range of learning tasks, including regression and optimisation, and compare and contrast with related models in the literature.},

The model allows the short rate to exhibit both mean reversion and conditional heteroskedasticity and nests the popular generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and square root process specifications. The conditional variance process accommodates volatility clustering and dependence on the level of the interest rate. A first-order Markov process with state-dependent transition probabilities governs the switching between regimes. The GRS model is compared with various existing models of the short rate in terms of (1) the statistical fit of short-term interest rate data and (2) out-of-sample forecasting performance.},

Employing a high-frequency VAR model based on 20 s data of a crosssection of stocks traded at the London Stock Exchange we find distinct responses in returns, volatility, trading volumes and bid-ask spreads due to news arrivals. We show that a classification of news according to indicated relevance is crucial to filter out noise and to identify significant effects. Moreover, sentiment indicators have predictability for future price trends though the profitability of news-implied trading is deteriorated by increased bid-ask spreads.},

Being provided with a unique high-frequency dataset, we are able to determine whether or not an order has been submitted by an algorithm. ``Algorithmic Trading'' engines allow order submissions without human intervention. We show that the cancellation probability of limit orders submitted by algorithms is significantly higher than the one of limit orders submitted by ``normal'' human traders. Furthermore, given exactly this difference we point out that the application of well-established ``traditional'' liquidity measurement methods may no longer be unequivocally applicable in electronic markets with a large degree of algorithmic activity. At least those liquidity measures that are based on ``committed liquidity'' need to be questioned.},

In this work, we propose a novel technical approach that augments a Bayesian non-parametric regression mixture model with multiple elastic nets. Using the enhanced mixture model, we can extract generalizable insights for a target model through a global approximation. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we evaluate it on different ML models in the context of image recognition. The empirical results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in explaining individual decisions but also provides users with an ability to discover the vulnerabilities of the target ML models.},

We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a cooperative, partialinformation game with two agents, human and robot; both are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL algorithm.},

This motivates empirical specifications in which the security price follows a random-walk plus transient disturbances that arise from the trading mechanism. This note is an overview of econometric approaches to characterizing the random-walk component in single- and multiple-price settings. Established techniques of random-walk decomposition provide useful characterizations of random-walk properties and (in the case of multiple markets) informational attributions. More general approaches based on the broader class of permanent/transitory decompositions suffer from problematic identification, a potential for misleading inference and lack of economic relevance.},

We first estimate demand models which do not restrict unduly the pattern of consumer preferences as does much previous research in the area of differenciated products. Using recently available transactions data we estimate own and cross price elasticities in a relatively unrestricted manner. We next turn to competitive analysis using our estimated demand system. We consider two applications in this paper. The main economic factor that we consider is that the firms which produce the differentiated products almost always tend to be multi-product firms in the given industry. Our first application is competitive analysis when two firms are allowed to merge. The other application that we consider is inference on the competitive structure in an industry. In both applications we consider the effect of a multi-product firm where its competitive decisions for one brand affects it sales and prices for other brands that it produces. /// La diff{\'e}renciation des produits est un aspect {\'e}conomique central de la concurrence sur les march{\'e}s des biens de consommations comme les c{\'e}r{\'e}ales, les sodas ou les bi{\`e}res.

Empirically, New York Stock Exchange intermediary data reveals economically large price pressures, 0.49\% on average with a half life of 0.92 days. Theoretically, a simple dynamic inventory model captures an intermediary's use of price pressure to mean-revert inventory. She trades off revenue loss due to price pressure against price risk associated with staying in a nonzero inventory state. The closed-form solution identifies the intermediary's risk aversion and the investors' private value distribution from the observed time series patterns of prices and inventories. These parameters imply a relative social cost due to price pressure, a deviation from constrained Pareto efficiency, of approximately 10\% of the cost of immediacy.},

Short selling predicts bond returns where private information is more likely, in high-yield bonds, particularly after Lehman Brothers' collapse of 2008. Short selling predicts returns following both high and low past bond returns. This, together with short selling increasing following past buying order imbalances, suggests short sellers trade against price pressures as well as trade on information. Short selling predicts bond returns both in the individual bonds that are shorted and in other bonds by the same issuer. Past stock returns and short selling in stocks predict bond returns but do not eliminate bond short selling predicting bond returns. Bond short selling does not predict the issuer's stock returns. These results show bond short sellers contribute to efficient bond prices and that short sellers' information flows from stocks to bonds but not from bonds to stocks.},

Positive (negative) complementarity in consumer preferences promotes downward (upward) bias in the futures price viewed as a predictor of the later spot price. I demonstrate that the conclusion derived from partial equilibrium analysis--that when speculators are risk averse, risk premia are a function of hedging pressure--fails in the general equilibrium analysis, so long as there are no transaction costs. A counterexample is analyzed in which, as consumers' additive logarithmic preferences are varied, producers' hedging positions change from long to short, while the futures risk premium remains unchanged. However, hedging pressure is reinstated as a force influencing risk premia in the sense that the futures price is downward biased when hedgers take short positions and is upward biased when hedgers take long positions, provided it can be assumed (as is usually valid) that fixed setup costs of trading deter consumers more than producers from participating in the futures market.},

Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and sometimes more efficiently than) a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient ``turnkey'' samplers.},

Because speed is a source of market power, it enables fast traders to extract rents from other market participants and triggers a costly arms race that reduces social welfare.

Within this early peek window, we find highly concentrated trading and a fast price discovery of less than 200 milliseconds. Outside this narrow window, general investors trade at fully adjusted prices. We further establish a causal relationship between the early peek mechanism and the fast price discovery by isolating the impact of the early peek arrangement along two dimensions. In cross section, we use other news releases without the early peek (as controls); in time series, we use the sudden suspension of the early peek arrangement in July 2013 (as the treatment). Our difference-in-difference tests directly connect the early peek arrangement to more efficient price discovery \textemdash{} it results in faster price discovery, lower volatility, and faster resolution of uncertainty. These results show that contrary to the common perception, tiered information release may help to reduce, rather than enhance, the informational advantage of faster traders and improve the efficiency of the price discovery process in financial markets.},

Our main goal is to investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. On the contrary, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency trading increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e., their ability to i) generate high bid-ask spreads and ii) synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book. Finally, we find that higher rates of order cancellation by high-frequency traders increase the incidence of flash crashes but reduce their duration.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of different regulatory policies directed towards high-frequency trading (HFT) through an agent-based model of a limit order book able to generate flash crashes as the result of the interactions between low- and high-frequency (HF) traders. We analyze the impact of the imposition of minimum resting times, of circuit breakers (both ex-post and ex-ante types), of cancellation fees and of transaction taxes on asset price volatility and on the occurrence and duration of flash crashes. In the model, low- frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. In contrast, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. In addition, high-frequency traders employ low-latency directional strategies that exploit market information and they can cancel their orders depending on expected profits. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that reducing HF order cancellation, via minimum resting times or cancellation fees, or discouraging HFT via financial transaction taxes, reduces market volatility and the frequency of flash crashes. However, these policies also imply a longer duration of flash crashes. Furthermore, the introduction of an ex-ante circuit breaker markedly reduces price volatility and removes flash crashes. In contrast, ex-post circuit breakers do not affect market volatility and they increase the duration of flash crashes. Our results show that HFT-targeted policies face a trade-off between market stability and resilience. Policies that reduce volatility and the incidence of flash crashes also imply a reduced ability of the market to quickly recover from a crash. The dual role of HFT, as both a cause of the flash crash and a fundamental actor in the post-crash recovery underlies the above trade-off.},

In particular, we overcome a well-known limitation in tests for market efficiency, i.e., the need to assume a particular equilibrium asset pricing model, called the joint-hypothesis or bad-model problem. Indeed, we show that an efficient market is completely characterized by the absence of both arbitrage opportunities and dominated securities, an insight that provides tests for efficiency that are devoid of the bad-model problem. Other theorems useful for both the testing of market efficiency and the pricing of derivatives are also provided.},

  abstract = {In the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase of interest in the Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models. This is primarily because of the emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps underappreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentifiability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so-called label switching in the MCMC output. This means that ergodic averages of component specific quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artificial identifiability constraints, relabelling algorithms and label invariant loss functions. We also review various MCMC sampling schemes that have been suggested for mixture models and discuss posterior sensitivity to prior specification.},

Beliefs about long-run dynamics are volatile, with counter-cyclical conditional volatility, and drift over time.

  abstract = {One of the unique features of the digital currency Bitcoin is that new cash is introduced by so-called miners carrying out resource-intensive proof-of-work operations. To increase their chances of obtaining freshly minted bitcoins, miners typically join pools to collaborate on the computations. However, intense competition among mining pools has recently manifested in two ways. Miners may invest in additional computing resources to increase the likelihood of winning the next mining race. But, at times, a more sinister tactic is also employed: a mining pool may trigger a costly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to lower the expected success outlook of a competing mining pool. We explore the trade-off between these strategies with a series of game-theoretical models of competition between two pools of varying sizes. We consider differences in costs of investment and attack, as well as uncertainty over whether a DDoS attack will succeed. By characterizing the game's equilibria, we can draw a number of conclusions. In particular, we find that pools have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small ones. We also observe that larger mining pools have a greater incentive to attack than smaller ones.},

In a Bayesian framework, this form of learning is inconsistent with the assumption, made in the past literature, of prior independence across funds. Independence can be viewed as an extreme scenario in which the true cross-sectional distribution of alphas is presumed to be known a priori.},

We provide strong evidence that non-scheduled company announcements and some macroeconomic announcements contribute jumps that follow the releases and also some evidence for pre-jumps that precede the scheduled arrivals of public information, which may indicate non-gradual information leakage. Especially interim reports of Nordic large-cap companies are found containing important information to yield jumps in stock prices. Additionally, our results show that releases of unexpected information are not reacted to uniformly across Nasdaq Nordic markets, even if they are jointly operated and are based on the same exchange rules.},

Furthermore, the importance of a common market factor is overestimated when using only the nearest futures data.

We find that the model matches market activity well when we allow for overconfidence. At plausible values of overconfidence and risk aversion, overconfidence--not hedging--explains nearly all uninformed trading, while rational informed speculation accounts for most overall trading. Without overconfident investors, over 99\% of trading volume disappears even when informed rational traders disagree maximally.

Specifically, we study price change, volume, and information asymmetry at the time of the announcement. We also investigate how information acquisition, information asymmetry, price, and volume are influenced by the quality of prior knowledge, the marginal cost of gathering information, the degree of risk tolerance, and noise. Finally, we compare market reactions to anticipated announcements of known precision with the response to announcements that are either unanticipated or of uncertain quality.},

In most realistic problems, the parameters of return distributions are unknown and are estimated using available economic data. Traditional analysis neglects estimation risk by treating the estimated parameters as if they were the true parameters to determine the optimal choice under uncertainty. We show that for normally distributed returns and `non-informative' or `invariant' priors, the admissible set of portfolios taking the estimation uncertainty into account is identical to that given by traditional analysis. However, as a result of estimation risk, the optimal portfolio choice differs from that obtained by traditional analysis. For other plausible priors, the admissible set, and consequently the optimal choice, is shown to differ from that in traditional analysis.},

Our approach is deeply rooted in Stochastic Portfolio Theory (SPT), a stochastic analysis framework introduced by Robert E. Fernholz that aims at flexibly analysing the performance of certain investment strategies in stock markets relative to benchmark indices. In particular, SPT has exhibited some investment strategies based on company sizes that, under realistic assumptions, outperform benchmark indices with probability 1 over certain time horizons. Galvanised by this result, we consider the inverse problem that consists of learning (from historical data) an optimal investment strategy based on any given set of trading characteristics, and using a user-specified optimality criterion that may go beyond outperforming a benchmark index. Although this inverse problem is of the utmost interest to investment management practitioners, it can hardly be tackled using the SPT framework. We show that our machine learning approach learns investment strategies that considerably outperform existing SPT strategies in the US stock market.},

While humans are usually able to correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However, deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with a length of 139.1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to practitioners and executives.},

We examine Bitcoin as a consensus game and determine that it relies on separate consensus about the rules and about game state. An important aspect of Bitcoin's design is the mining mechanism, in which participants expend resources on solving computational puzzles in order to collect rewards. This mechanism purportedly protects Bitcoin against certain technical problems such as inconsistencies in the system's distributed log data structure. We consider the economics of Bitcoin mining, and whether the Bitcoin protocol can survive attacks, assuming that participants behave according to their incentives. We show that there is a Nash equilibrium in which all players behave consistently with Bitcoin's reference implementation, along with infinitely many equilibria in which they behave otherwise. We also show how a motivated adversary might be able to disrupt the Bitcoin system and ``crash'' the currency. Finally, we argue that Bitcoin will require the emergence of governance structures, contrary to the commonly held view in the Bitcoin community that the currency is ungovernable.},

  abstract = {In many machine learning applications, the training distribution used to learn a probabilistic classifier differs from the testing distribution on which the classifier will be used to make predictions. Traditional methods correct the distribution shift by reweighting the training data with the ratio of the density between test and training data. But in many applications training takes place without prior knowledge of the testing. Recently, methods have been proposed to address the shift by learning causal structure, but they rely on the diversity of multiple training data to a good performance, and have complexity limitations in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Global Balancing Regression algorithm to jointly optimize a deep auto-encoder model and a global balancing model for stable prediction across unknown environments. The global balancing model constructs balancing weights that facilitate estimating of partial effects of features, a problem that is challenging in high dimensions, and thus helps to identify stable, causal relationships between features and outcomes. The deep auto-encoder model is designed to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thus making global balancing easier. We show, both theoretically and with empirical experiments, that our algorithm can make stable predictions across unknown environments.},

The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camouflage which conceals his trading from market makers. As the time interval between auctions goes to zero, a limiting model of continuous trading is obtained.

An examination of information aggregation in a non-competitive rational expectations model using a Nash equilibrium in demand functions shows that the schizophrenia problem is avoided by having each trader take into account the effect his demand has on the equilibrium price. Given a distribution of private information across traders, prices reveal less information than in the competition equilibrium, and prices no longer become fully informative in the limit as noise trading vanishes or as traders become risk neutral. With small traders, the model may become one of monopolistic competition, not perfect competition. In contrast to the competitive model, a reasonable model of endogenous acquisition of costly private information is obtained, even when traders are risk-neutral.]},

Second, restrictions can be derived using dimensional analysis and leverage neutrality, as suggested by Kyle and Obizhaeva (2017b). Except for the knife-edged case of the square root market impact function, additional assumptions related to market microstructure invariance are needed to apply the same market impact formula to all assets simultaneously.

A second phase of latency decrease can be attributed to line-of-sight microwave networks, operating primarily in the 6-11 GHz region of the spectrum, licensed during 2011 and 2012. Using publicly available information, we estimate these networks' latencies and bandwidths. We estimate the total infrastructure and 5-year operations costs associated with these latency improvements to exceed \$500 million.},

We document two potential problems with quote-based methods of trade classification: quotes may be recorded ahead of trades that triggered them, and trades inside the spread are not readily classifiable. These problems are analyzed in the context of the interaction between exchange floor agents. We then propose and test relatively simple procedures for improving trade classifications.},

The notion of a post-model-selection estimator here refers to the combined procedure resulting from first selecting a model (e.g., by a model selection criterion such as AIC or by a hypothesis testing procedure) and then estimating the parameters in the selected model (e.g., by least-squares or maximum likelihood), all based on the same data set. We show that it is impossible to estimate this distribution with reasonable accuracy even asymptotically. In particular, we show that no estimator for this distribution can be uniformly consistent (not even locally). This follows as a corollary to (local) minimax lower bounds on the performance of estimators for this distribution. Similar impossibility results are also obtained for the conditional distribution of linear functions (e.g., predictors) of the post-model-selection estimator.},

A difference-in-differences empirical strategy reveals that substitution to bank debt and alternative sources of capital (e.g., equity, cash balances, and trade credit) was limited, leading to an almost one-for-one decline in net investment with the decline in net debt issuances. Despite this sharp change in behavior, corporate leverage ratios remained relatively stable, a result of the contemporaneous decline in debt issuances and investment. Overall, our findings highlight how even large firms with access to public credit markets are susceptible to fluctuations in the supply of capital.},

It also examines the impacts of belief dispersion and calendar effect as well as oil price movement between the releases of the American Petroleum Institute (API) and EIA reports. Market activity, in terms of price return, volatility and trading volume, responds to inventory shock very quickly, with the effects lasting for about twenty-five minutes. Our results suggest that a positive (negative) inventory shock will result in an immediate price decline (rise), while both kinds of shock increase volatility and trading volume; however, the price reverts quickly after the initial reaction. Moreover, wider belief dispersion is associated with a larger market response to inventory shock. Last, we discuss some intraday trading strategies on EIA report days. Interestingly, we exhibit an even better strategy than the ``natural'' one of going long (short) after the announcement of a lower-than-expected inventory at 10:30, that is, an alternate strategy that follows the market move between 10:20 and 10:25. This indicates that some market participants may benefit from wireless towers or other systems giving them access to the news prior to its release by the EIA (www.eia.org).},

Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag  in a Web page. Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature. According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined. By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant. Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts. Based on the answer set generated from 13 manually tagged news Web sites with a total of 26,518 Web pages, experiments show that both recall and precision rates are greater than 0.956. That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc. By adopting InfoDiscoverer as the preprocessor of information retrieval and extraction applications, the retrieval and extracting precision will be increased, and the indexing size and extracting complexity will also be reduced.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of strategic order activities during the pre-opening session of trading halts on post-halt return and volatility. Strategic orders are non-binding, aggressive limit orders that are placed in the pre-opening phase but subsequently cancelled or revised shortly before the market re-opens. We develop a model which shows that in the presence of strategic orders, price reverts as informed traders deliberately inflate or deflate the price and flip when the halt is lifted. The model further shows that strategic order activity increases with the level of information asymmetry and liquidity. Additionally, our model shows that the level of post-halt volatility is higher when strategic order is present. Our theoretical conjecture is empirically tested and results broadly confirm with the model prediction. We argue that strategic order activities help explaining the positive linkage between news uncertainty and post-halt volatility, which is documented by extant studies on trading halt. Our findings provide important implications for regulators. The classification of the strategic limit orders scheme used in this study could assist policy makers or market surveillance bodies in identifying potential order book manipulation.},

In this article, I review the case for and against the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, and describe a new framework\textemdash{}the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis\textemdash{}in which the traditional models of modern financial economics can co-exist alongside behavioral models in an intellectually consistent manner. Based on evolutionary principles, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis implies that the degree of market efficiency is related to environmental factors characterizing market ecology such as the number of competitors in the market, the magnitude of profit opportunities available, and the adaptability of the market participants. Many of the examples that behavioralists cite as violations of rationality that are inconsistent with market efficiency\textemdash{}loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases\textemdash{}are, in fact, consistent with an evolutionary model of individuals adapting to a changing environment via simple heuristics. Despite the qualitative nature of this new paradigm, I show that the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis yields a number of surprisingly concrete applications for both investment managers and consultants.},

This is supported in survey data and is reflected in firm level option prices. We embed these expectations into an asset pricing model and show that we jointly explain the following stylized facts: when volatility increases the equity and variance risk premiums fall or stay flat at short horizons, despite higher future risk; these premiums appear to rise at longer horizons after future volatility has subsided; strategies that time volatility generate alpha; the variance risk premium forecasts stock returns more strongly than either realized variance or risk-neutral variance (VIX); changes in volatility are negatively correlated with contemporaneous returns. Slow moving expectations about volatility results in a weak, or even negative, risk-return tradeoff at shorter horizons but a stronger tradeoff at longer horizons (beyond where one can strongly forecast volatility). These dynamics are mirrored in the VIX and variance risk premium which reflect investor expectations about volatility.},

For example, public firms' controlling shareholders' diversification is positively related to their investment and profitability ratios, while the opposite relations are observed for private firms. Our theoretical and empirical results suggest that the differences between public and private firms' external financing costs coupled with firms' controlling owners' underdiversification are at least partially responsible for the observed relations between firms' mode of incorporation and their investment and operating strategies and outcomes.},

In this paper, we analyze the price impact of limit order cancellations. Cancellations have been traditionally considered as a part of order book imbalance measures. Distinct from previous studies, we estimate a vector autoregressive (VAR) specification that explicitly models cancellations as a separate event. We find a negative relationship between limit order cancellations and cumulative quote changes. On average, a buy (sell) side cancellation permanently decreases (increases) stock prices. However, a temporary overreaction on quotes is observed immediately after the event of cancellation. We document that this overreaction is produced by high frequency traders' (HFTs) activity, submitting and quickly cancelling limit orders, feasibly to move quotes in order to rapidly profit from trading the induced transitory mispricing. These findings suggest that HFTs' cancellation activity is not informative but non-HFTs' limit order cancellations convey information. This result has an important policy implication since policy makers have recently suggested the introduction of a minimum period of time a limit order should be kept on the order book to avoid speculative practices. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence supporting that.},

Now trading is increasingly done in anonymous electronic markets where traders do not have designated functions or mandatory roles. In fact, the traders themselves have been replaced by algorithms (machines) operating with little or no human oversight. While the process of electronic trading is not visible to a human eye, machine-learning methods have been developed to recognize persistent patterns in the data. In this study, we develop a dynamic machine-learning method that designates 15,686 traders in the E-mini S\&P 500 stock index futures market into five persistent categories. Our method is based on a plaid clustering technique enhanced by a smoothing framework that filters out transient patterns. With the exception of high frequency traders (14 traders), the resulting categories of traders -- market makers (271 traders), opportunistic traders (7126), fundamental traders (254), and small traders (8021) -- play well-known, albeit it non-designated, market functions. High frequency traders, on the other hand, leave a distinctly more profound footprint in an electronic market.},

  abstract = {Modern investors face a high-dimensional prediction problem: thousands of observable variables are potentially relevant for forecasting. We reassess the conventional wisdom on market efficiency in light of this fact. In our model economy, which resembles a typical machine learning setting, N assets have cash flows that are a linear function of J firm characteristics, but with uncertain coefficients. Risk-neutral Bayesian investors impose shrinkage (ridge regression) or sparsity (Lasso) when they estimate the J coefficients of the model and use them to price assets. When J is comparable in size to N, returns appear cross-sectionally predictable using firm characteristics to an econometrician who analyzes data from the economy ex post. A factor zoo emerges even without p-hacking and data-mining. Standard in-sample tests of market efficiency reject the no-predictability null with high probability, despite the fact that investors optimally use the information available to them in real time. In contrast, out-of-sample tests retain their economic meaning.},

We achieve this by reconstructing the full history of the limit order book and formulate the case as a binary classification supervised learning problem. The results presented in this study suggest that using the information at the microstructure level of the order book is highly efficient for predicting and detecting the cancelation of the large order than using information at the macrostructure level, and that predicting the cancelation is marginally outperformed by the detection case. With this, we make a step forward in identifying potential orders related to price manipulation but the results can be used by institutional traders to anticipate adversary market impact produced by large orders.},

Using a sample of firms that filed for bankruptcy between 1995 and 2012 to identify firms that cease as a going concern, we find that both management's opinion about going concern reported in the MD\&A and the linguistic tone of the MD\&A together provide significant explanatory power in predicting whether a firm will cease as a going concern. Moreover, the predictive ability of MD\&A disclosure is incremental to financial ratios, market-based variables, and even the auditor's going concern opinion. We also find that the incremental predictive ability of MD\&A disclosures extends to three years prior to bankruptcy.},

Our principal findings are that ownership changes are not a primary vehicle for cuts in employment and wages, or closing plants. Instead, the typical ownership change increases jobs and their quality as measured by wages. However, some ownership changes, particularly those in bigger plants, are associated with job loss, and the typical worker fares much worse than the typical plant. Finally, we find that plants that changed owners have a higher probability of survival than those that did not. Overall, the impact of ownership changes on labor markets are positive.},

This paper is about a novel model-free IRL approach that, differently from most of the existing IRL algorithms, does not require to specify a function space where to search for the expert's reward function. Leveraging on the fact that the policy gradient needs to be zero for any optimal policy, the algorithm generates a set of basis functions that span the subspace of reward functions that make the policy gradient vanish. Within this subspace, using a second-order criterion, we search for the reward function that penalizes the most a deviation from the expert's policy. After introducing our approach for finite domains, we extend it to continuous ones. The proposed approach is empirically compared to other IRL methods both in the (finite) Taxi domain and in the (continuous) Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and Car on the Hill environments.},

This can be viewed as a very simple agent based model in which all components of the model are validated against real data. Our empirical studies of order flow uncover several interesting regularities in the way trading orders are placed and cancelled. The resulting simple model of order flow is used to simulate price formation under a continuous double auction, and the statistical properties of the resulting simulated sequence of prices are compared to those of real data. The model is constructed using one stock (AZN) and tested on 24 other stocks. For low volatility, small tick size stocks (called Group I) the predictions are very good, but for stocks outside Group I they are not good. For Group I, the model predicts the correct magnitude and functional form of the distribution of the volatility and the bid-ask spread, without adjusting any parameters based on prices. This suggests that at least for Group I stocks, the volatility and heavy tails of prices are related to market microstructure effects, and supports the hypothesis that, at least on short time scales, the large fluctuations of absolute returns are well described by a power law with an exponent that varies from stock to stock.},

Applying the method to past-return-based prediction of future returns, short-term returns become the most important predictors. A trading strategy based on our findings has an information ratio twice as high as a Fama-MacBeth regression accounting for two-way interactions. Transaction costs do not explain the results.},

Using a large cross-country data set, we find that public listed firms are better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities than private firms. Specifically, public listed firms exhibit higher investment sensitivity to growth opportunities than private firms. This differential, however, only exists in countries with well-developed stock markets. Furthermore, the relative advantage public firms have at allocating capital depends on the degree of agency costs and reliance on external equity.},

Management is assumed to know more about the firm's value than potential investors. Investors interpret the firm's actions rationally. An equilibrium model of the issue-invest decision is developed under these assumptions. The model shows that firms may refuse to issue stock, and therefore may pass up valuable investment opportunities. The model suggests explanations for several aspects of corporate financing behavior, including the tendency to rely on internal sources of funds, and to prefer debt to equity if external financing is required. Extensions and applications of the model are discussed.},

We rst characterize the set of all reward  functions for which a given policy is  optimal. We then derive three algorithms  for IRL. The rst two deal with the case  where the entire policy is known; we handle  tabulated reward functions on a nite state  space and linear functional approximation of  the reward function over a potentially in-  nite state space. The third algorithm deals  with the more realistic case in which the policy  is known only through a nite set of observed  trajectories. In all cases, a key issue is  degeneracy|the existence of a large set of reward  functions for which the observed policy  is optimal. To remove...},

This work follows design science research to guide the implementation of a blockchain-based proof-of-concept prototype that enables the automated transaction of real-world assets, such as cars, and provides a valid, transparent, and immutable record of vehicle history to market participants, authorities, and other third parties. The contribution of this study to existing research is threefold: First, it introduces a built-in mechanism to reduce transaction risk resulting from the irreversibility of transactions in blockchain-based systems. Second, it replaces a trust-based, centralized, and bureaucratic register with a tamper-free and autonomous transactional database system that comprises a secure registration and transaction process. Third, it proposes a novel approach to mitigate adverse selection effects in lemon markets by providing a reliable, transparent, and complete record of each marketable asset's history. In total, the findings in this article illustrate the potential of blockchain-based systems but also highlight technological shortcomings and challenges for commercial applications, such as scalability or privacy issues.},

Profitable firms generate significantly higher returns than unprofitable firms, despite having significantly higher valuation ratios. Controlling for profitability also dramatically increases the performance of value strategies, especially among the largest, most liquid stocks. These results are difficult to reconcile with popular explanations of the value premium, as profitable firms are less prone to distress, have longer cash flow durations, and have lower levels of operating leverage. Controlling for gross profitability explains most earnings related anomalies, and a wide range of seemingly unrelated profitable trading strategies.},

Our main contribution is to explain why real-time estimation of distributions with non-normal tails are prone to large uncertainty fluctuations. We use theory and data to show how small changes in estimated skewness whip around probabilities of unobserved tail events (black swans). Our estimates, based on real-time GDP data, reveal that revisions in the estimates of black swan risk explain most of the fluctuations in uncertainty.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining efficient estimates for the parameters of a system of M regression equations. The disturbance terms of this system are assumed to be related by both serial and contemporaneous correlation. Under the further assumption that the serial correlation is a first order autoregressive process, the paper develops an estimator that is consistent and has the same asymptotic normal distribution as the Aitken estimator which assumes the covariance matrix to be known. The paper concludes with a discussion of some alternative covariance specifications and points out certain difficulties with the standard single equation procedures for handling auto-regressive schemes.},

Substantial prior uncertainty about mispricing often produces an estimated cost of equity close to that obtained with mispricing precluded, even for a stock whose average return departs significantly from the pricing model's prediction. Uncertainty about which pricing model to use is less important, on average, than within-model parameter uncertainty. In the absence of mispricing uncertainty, uncertainty about factor premiums is generally the largest source of overall uncertainty about a firm's cost of equity, although uncertainty about betas is nearly as important.},

Starting with a view on value as a coordination mechanism that defines meaningful action within a certain context, we associate the price system with the establishment of capitalism and the industrial economy. We then discuss its relevance to the information economy, exhibited as the techno-economic context of the sharing economy, and identify new modalities of value creation that better reflect the social relations of sharing. Through the illustrative case of Backfeed, a new system of value is envisioned, comprising three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; and (c) actualisation of value. In this framework, we discuss the solutions featured by Backfeed and describe a conceptual economic model of blockchain-based decentralised cooperation. We conclude with a tentative scenario for blockchain technology that can enable the creation of commons-oriented ecosystems in a sharing economy.},

Growth in investment reduces reported earnings and creates reserves. Reducing investment releases those reserves, increasing earnings. If the change in investment is temporary, then current earnings is temporarily depressed or inflated, and thus is not a good indicator of future earnings. This study develops diagnostic measures of this joint effect of investment and conservative accounting. We find that these measures forecast differences in future return on net operating assets relative to current return on net operating assets. Moreover, these measures also forecast stock returns-indicating that investors do not appreciate how conservatism and changes in investment combine to raise questions about the quality of reported earnings.},

  abstract = {This article examines the theoretical and empirical implications of asymmetric information in commodity futures markets. In particular, it formulates and tests a theoretical model that recognizes two distinct categories of traders: hedgers, who participate in both spot and futures markets, and speculators, who participate only in the futures market. Speculators are assumed to possess differential information about the realized values of selected random variables. Multiperiod futures market equilibria are derived under competitive conditions, and the ability of futures markets to forecast changes in equilibrium spot market prices are examined. The key variable is shown to be the randomness and informational asymmetry in the aggregate supply by participating hedgers in the spot market, whose absence turns out to be the major determinant of the revelation of informational asymmetry. Moreover, under the assumption of independence of error forecasts for prices and spot market supplies, it is shown that futures market equilibrium ends up with linear expressions for prices and futures contract volumes. These linear expressions are then used to develop empirically testable models. The main empirical implications in these models revolve around the role of the basis as a predictor of future spot price changes. The paper provides an empirical investigation of these implications, using three commodities traded on the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE). \textcopyright{} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

The classic q theory performs better in firms and years with more intangible capital: Total and even physical investment are better explained by Tobin's q and are less sensitive to cash flow.

Our study contributes by revealing how the different motivations of OSS developers are interrelated, how these motivations influence participation leading to performance, and how past performance influences subsequent motivations. Drawing on theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, we develop a theoretical model relating the motivations, participation, and performance of OSS developers. We evaluate our model using survey and archival data collected from a longitudinal field study of software developers in the Apache projects. Our results reveal several important findings. First, we find that developers' motivations are not independent but rather are related in complex ways. Being paid to contribute to Apache projects is positively related to developers' status motivations but negatively related to their use-value motivations. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no evidence of diminished intrinsic motivation in the presence of extrinsic motivations; rather, status motivations enhance intrinsic motivations. Second, we find that different motivations have an impact on participation in different ways. Developers' paid participation and status motivations lead to above-average contribution levels, but use-value motivations lead to below-average contribution levels, and intrinsic motivations do not significantly impact average contribution levels. Third, we find that developers' contribution levels positively impact their performance rankings. Finally, our results suggest that past-performance rankings enhance developers' subsequent status motivations.},

We find that while the presence of HFT always improves market quality under symmetric information, under asymmetric information this is the case only if competition between high-frequency traders is sufficiently strong. While HFT does not negatively impact investor welfare, it reduces the welfare of slow speculators. The flexibility of the model allows investigating the effect of the main recent regulatory initiatives designed to curb HFT on market quality and investor welfare. We consider time-in-force rules, cancellation fees, transaction taxes, rebate fee structures, and speed bumps. While some of these regulations lead to improvements in a number of market quality measures, this generally does not translate into higher welfare for long-term investors. Rather, the main effect of such regulations is to generate wealth transfers from high-frequency traders to slow speculators. These regulations therefore appear inadequate to enhance investor welfare in the presence of HFTs. Of the different measures, transaction taxes are the least harmful; while they reduce welfare roughly by the amount of the tax, they do not significantly worsen market quality. The common practice by exchanges of granting rebates to limit orders is detrimental to market quality and investor welfare, causing both higher effective spreads and longer execution times.},

In the first stage firms make capacity decisions followed by a product-differentiated, price setting game in the second stage. Since costs are endogenized through the first stage, this has important implications for the measurement of market power in the product market. In particular, simpler one-stage specifications would result in a bias in the measurement of market power, which can be linked to the taxonomy for two-stage games given in Fudenberg and Tirole (1984) [Fudenberg, D., Tirole, J., 1984. ``The Fat-Cat Effect, the Puppy-Dog Ploy and the Lean and Hungry Look'', American Economic Review (Paper and Proceedings) 74, 361\textendash{}366]. We then estimate this model \textendash{} demand, cost (short and long run), and conduct \textendash{} for the European Airline Industry using data for the period of 1976\textendash{}1990. We perform a number of specification tests and reject a simple one-stage specification in favor of our two-stage set-up. In particular, we find that some degree of market power in the product market exists. However, market conduct in the two-stage set-up is significantly less collusive than in the more widely employed one-stage specification, which is consistent with the direction of bias in puppy-dog games. This illustrates that collusiveness of firms' market conduct in the product market is significantly overestimated whenever capacity competition is not accounted for.},

The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.]},

These goods are priced at marginal cost, contrary to proprietary ones which are produced by a monopoly owned by the inventor. We show that philanthropy does not necessarily increase long-run growth and that it may even reduce welfare. The reason is that it crowds out proprietary innovation which on net may reduce total innovation in the long run. These effects would be reinforced if philanthropical innovation diverted people from other productive activities, if free goods were less taylored to customers than proprietary ones, and if philanthropical inventors sometimes came out with another version of an existing proprietary good. Dynamics can also be characterized and it is shown that the impact effect of free inventions on growth is positive. (JEL: L12, L13, L16, L86, O31, O32, O34)},

Firstly, we categorize the virtual servers in the trading system of TSE, each of which is linked to a single trading participant, by the ratio of cancellation and execution in the order placement as well as the number of executions at the opening of the afternoon session. Then, we analyze ordering patterns of the servers in the categories in short intervals for the top 10 highest trading volume stocks. By classifying the intervals into four cases by returns, we observe how different types of market participants submit or execute orders in the market situations. Moreover, we investigate the shares of the executed volumes for the different types of servers in the swings and roundabouts of the Nikkei 225 index, which were observed in July, August, and September in 2015. The main findings of this study are as follows: Server type A, which supposedly includes non-market making proprietary traders with high-speed algorithmic strategies, executes and places orders along with the direction of the market. The shares of the execution and order volumes along with the market direction increase when the stock price moves sharply. Server type B, which presumably includes servers employing a market making strategy with high cancellation and low execution ratio, shifts its market making price ranges in the rapid price movements. We observe that passive servers in Server type B have a large share and buy at low levels in the price falls. Also, Server type B, as well as Server type A, makes profit in the price falling days and particularly, the aggressive servers in the server type make most of the profit. Server type C, which is assumed to include servers receiving orders from small investors, constantly has a large share of execution and order volume.},

This positive relation holds for individual stocks, for various test portfolios, and even for bonds and currencies, suggesting that beta is after all an important measure of systematic risk. Furthermore, a robust risk\textendash{}return trade-off exists on announcement days. Expected variance is positively related to future aggregated quarterly announcement day returns, but not to aggregated non-announcement day returns.

Using Huang and Stoll's (1997) model of liquidity costs, we estimate whether changes to liquidity costs are driven by its adverse selection, inventory, or order processing components. Commodity index fund roll activity reduces the asymmetric information cost component of liquidity cost due to an increased proportion of noninformation-based trading, but the inventory cost component increases as (mostly long only) commodity index funds sell their nearby positions and buy the first deferred contract\textemdash{}raising liquidity providers' risk of building a position. The sum of these two effects is that liquidity costs remain low during index fund roll periods, averaging one ``tick'' (0.25 cents). On USDA report release days, we find that informed traders raise the asymmetric information component of liquidity costs in the first hour after release, but the inventory cost component is reduced due to the increase in volume. Similar to index fund roll activity, liquidity costs on USDA report release days remain low, averaging one ``tick''. Our findings that liquidity costs are minimally changed during USDA report releases and commodity index fund roll periods is consistent with other recent research on liquidity costs, but we show that what drives liquidity costs differs substantially depending on the circumstances surrounding daily trading.},

The design of the architecture takes advantage of the specific structure of limit order books. The new architecture, which we refer to as a ``spatial neural network'', yields a low-dimensional model of price movements deep into the limit order book, allowing more effective use of information from deep in the limit order book (i.e., many levels beyond the best bid and best ask). The spatial neural network models the joint distribution of the state of the limit order book at a future time conditional on the current state of the limit order book. The spatial neural network outperforms status quo models such as the naive empirical model, logistic regression (with nonlinear features), and a standard neural network architecture. Both neural networks strongly outperform the logistic regression model. Due to its more effective use of information deep in the limit order book, the spatial neural network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the tail of the distribution, which is important for risk management applications. The models are trained and tested on nearly 500 U.S. stocks. Techniques from deep learning such as dropout are employed to improve performance. Due to the significant computational challenges associated with the large amount of data, models are trained with a cluster of 50 GPUs.},

The rigidity induced by the cryptocurrency price having to clear these two sides, especially with strong complementarity in membership demand, leads to either no or two equilibria. The possibility of no equilibria (platform failure) discourages the platform developer from committing ex ante to disclosing all relevant information about the platform to the public. In contrast, in a conventional two-fee platform, where the developer can set separate membership and service fees, the \textdaggerdbl{}exibility in pricing ensures a unique equilibrium. As a result, the developer would prefer full information disclosure if it funds the platform through a traditional IPO.},

Our approach relies on an ecological modelling inspired from the r/K selection theory, and is designed to assess the relative financial performance of two classes of aggressive HFT agents endowed with dissimilar computational capabilities. We use a discrete-event news simulation system to capture the information processing disparity and order transfer delay, and simulate the dynamics of the market.

  abstract = {Market microstructure deals with the purest form of financial intermediation \textendash{} the trading of a financial asset, such as a stock or a bond. In a trading market, assets are not transformed but are simply transferred from one investor to another. The field of market microstructure studies the cost of trading securities and the impact of trading costs on the short-run behavior of securities prices. Costs are reflected in the bid-ask spread (and related measures) and in commissions. The focus of this chapter is on the determinants of the spread rather than on commissions. After an introduction to markets, traders and the trading process, I review the theory of the bid\textendash{}ask spread in Section~3 and examine the implications of the spread for the short-run behavior of prices in Section~4. In Section~5, the empirical evidence on the magnitude and nature of trading costs is summarized, and inferences are drawn about the importance of various sources of the spread. Price impacts of trading from block trades, from herding or from other sources, are considered in Section~6. Issues in the design of a trading market, such as the functioning of call versus continuous markets and of dealer versus auction markets, are examined in Section~7. Even casual observers of markets have undoubtedly noted the surprising pace at which new trading markets are being established even as others merge. Section~8 briefly surveys recent developments in securities markets in the USA and considers the forces leading to centralization of trading in a single market versus the forces leading to multiple markets. Most of this chapter deals with the microstructure of equities markets. In Section~9, the microstructure of other markets is considered. Section~10 provides a brief discussion of the implications of microstructure for asset pricing. Section~11 concludes.},

We first cover continuous time contingent claims models, starting with real options models, and working through static and dynamic capital structure models.

We cover the basic model with no financing, as well as more elaborate models that include features such as costly external finance, cash holding, and both safe and risky debt. For all the models, we offer a minimalist, simplified presentation with a great deal of intuition.  Throughout, we show how these models can answer questions concerning the effects of financial constraints on investment, the level of corporate leverage, the speed of adjustment of leverage to its target, and market timing, among others. Finally, we review and explain structural estimation of corporate finance models.},

Moreover, the analysis reveals that the effect of competition is greater in industries in which small firms face financially strong rivals, in industries with intense strategic interactions between firms, and in illiquid industries. Overall, these findings suggest that banks price financial contracts by taking into account the risk that arises from product market competition.},

It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages. We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented in the context of models denoted by probabilistic programs. In the second part of this document, we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming language, with a functionality analogous to that of established programming languages. This affords the opportunity to define models with dynamic computation graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that generate samples by repeatedly executing the program. Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of probabilistic programming language are explained in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller. This document closes with a chapter on advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of writing, interesting directions for probabilistic programming research; directions that point towards a tight integration with deep neural network research and the development of systems for next-generation artificial intelligence applications.},

Starting from around 3 000 different posts made between May 2011 and October 2013, we document 142 unique DDoS attacks on 40 Bitcoin services. We find that 7 \% of all known operators have been attacked, but that currency exchanges, mining pools, gambling operators, eWallets, and financial services are much more likely to be attacked than other services. Not coincidentally, we find currency exchanges and mining pools are much more likely to have DDoS protection such as CloudFlare, Incapsula, or Amazon Cloud. We show that those services that have been attacked are more than three times as likely to buy anti-DDoS services than operators who have not been attacked. We find that big mining pools (those with historical hashrate shares of at least 5 \%) are much more likely to be DDoSed than small pools. We investigate Mt. Gox as a case study for DDoS attacks on currency exchanges and find a disproportionate amount of DDoS reports made during the large spike in trading volume and exchange rates in spring 2013. We conclude by outlining future opportunities for researching DDoS attacks on Bitcoin.},

Since it provides more complete and in-depth results, aspect-level sentiment analysis has received much attention these years. In this paper, we reveal that the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not only determined by the content but is also highly related to the concerned aspect. For instance, ``The appetizers are ok, but the service is slow.'', for aspect taste, the polarity is positive while for service, the polarity is negative. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the connection between an aspect and the content of a sentence. To this end, we propose an Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory Network for aspect-level sentiment classification. The attention mechanism can concentrate on different parts of a sentence when different aspects are taken as input. We experiment on the SemEval 2014 dataset and results show that our model achieves state-ofthe-art performance on aspect-level sentiment classification.},

Instead of using one model to learn everything, we propose a novel paradigm centered around the learning and manipulation of *theories*, which parsimoniously predict both aspects of the future (from past observations) and the domain in which these predictions are accurate. Specifically, we propose a novel generalized-mean-loss to encourage each theory to specialize in its comparatively advantageous domain, and a differentiable description length objective to downweight bad data and "snap" learned theories into simple symbolic formulas. Theories are stored in a "theory hub", which continuously unifies learned theories and can propose theories when encountering new environments. We test our implementation, the "AI Physicist" learning agent, on a suite of increasingly complex physics environments. From unsupervised observation of trajectories through worlds involving random combinations of gravity, electromagnetism, harmonic motion and elastic bounces, our agent typically learns faster and produces mean-squared prediction errors about a billion times smaller than a standard feedforward neural net of comparable complexity, typically recovering integer and rational theory parameters exactly. Our agent successfully identifies domains with different laws of motion also for a nonlinear chaotic double pendulum in a piecewise constant force field.},

  abstract = {Many market participants now employ algorithmic trading, commonly defined as the use of computer algorithms, to automatically make certain trading decisions, submit orders and manage those orders after submission. Identifying and understanding the impact of algorithmic trading on financial markets has become a critical issue for market operators and regulators. Advanced data feeds and audit trail information from market operators now allow for the full observation of market participants' actions. A key question is the extent to which it is possible to understand and characterize the behaviour of individual participants from observations of trading actions. In this paper, we consider the basic problems of categorizing and recognizing traders (or, equivalently, trading algorithms) on the basis of observed limit orders. These problems are of interest to regulators engaged in strategy identification for the purposes of fraud detection and policy development. Methods have been suggested in the literature for describing trader behaviour using classification rules defined over a feature space consisting of summary trading statistics of volume and inventory, along with derived variables that reflect the consistency of buying or selling behaviour. Our principal contribution is to suggest an entirely different feature space that is constructed by inferring key parameters of a sequential optimization model that we take as a surrogate for the decision-making process of the traders. In particular, we model trader behaviour in terms of a Markov decision process. We infer the reward (or objective) function for this process from observations of trading actions using a process from machine learning known as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The reward functions learned through IRL then constitute a feature space that can be the basis for supervised learning (for classification or recognition of traders) or unsupervised learning (for categorization of traders). Making use of a real-world data-set from the E-Mini futures contract, we compare two principal IRL variants, linear IRL and Gaussian Process IRL, against a method based on summary trading statistics. Results suggest that IRL-based feature spaces support accurate classification and meaningful clustering. Further, we argue that, because they attempt to learn traders' underlying value propositions under different market conditions, the IRL methods are more informative and robust than the summary statistic-based approach and are well suited for discovering new behaviour patterns of market participants.},

The volatility of the price volatility appears excessive, which is a result of the fact that a more aggressive trading strategy is chosen by the insider when uninformed volume is higher.

The paper finds that order cancellation plays an important role in several trading strategies adopted by some limit order traders. These strategies are the order splitting strategy, the undercutting strategy, and the limit order replacement strategy. These three trading strategies, which involve cancellations, account for up to 85 percent of all the cancellation orders in the sample. The paper also finds that, subsequent to cancellations, limit order traders are most likely to withdraw from trading. If they choose to re-enter the market, they are most likely to resubmit the limit orders with more aggressive limit prices, than to replace the cancelled orders with market orders. The paper also shows that the decision of traders to cancel their orders is influenced by certain market and order characteristics. A limit order trader is more likely to cancel his limit buy (sell) order when there is a positive (negative) change in the bid (ask), and when there is an increase in the price of the stock, after the order is submitted. He is also more likely to cancel his limit order when the spread increases after he submits his order and as the day proceeds. However, he is less likely to cancel his orders at the last half hour of trading.},

  abstract = {A major approach to overcoming the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use sharding which is to split the overheads of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. These groups work in parallel to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation, and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability, these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems.},

  abstract = {We develop a large-scale deep learning model to predict price movements from limit order book (LOB) data of cash equities. The architecture utilises convolutional filters to capture the spatial structure of the limit order books as well as LSTM modules to capture longer time dependencies. The model is trained using electronic market quotes from the London Stock Exchange. Our model delivers a remarkably stable out-of-sample prediction accuracy for a variety of instruments and outperforms existing methods such as Support Vector Machines, standard Multilayer Perceptrons, as well as other previously proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The results obtained lead to good profits in a simple trading simulation, especially when compared with the baseline models. Importantly, our model translates well to instruments which were not part of the training set, indicating the model's ability to extract universal features. In order to better understand these features and to go beyond a ``black box'' model, we perform a sensitivity analysis to understand the rationale behind the model predictions and reveal the components of LOBs that are most relevant. The ability to extract robust features which translate well to other instruments is an important property of our model which has many other applications.},

  abstract = {We showcase how dropout variational inference can be applied to a large-scale deep learning model that predicts price movements from limit order books (LOBs), the canonical data source representing trading and pricing movements. We demonstrate that uncertainty information derived from posterior predictive distributions can be utilised for position sizing, avoiding unnecessary trades and improving profits. Further, we test our models by using millions of observations across several instruments and markets from the London Stock Exchange. Our results suggest that those Bayesian techniques not only deliver uncertainty information that can be used for trading but also improve predictive performance as stochastic regularisers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply Bayesian networks to LOBs.},

  abstract = {Reliable uncertainty estimation for time series prediction is critical in many fields, including physics, biology, and manufacturing. At Uber, probabilistic time series forecasting is used for robust prediction of number of trips during special events, driver incentive allocation, as well as real-time anomaly detection across millions of metrics. Classical time series models are often used in conjunction with a probabilistic formulation for uncertainty estimation. However, such models are hard to tune, scale, and add exogenous variables to. Motivated by the recent resurgence of Long Short Term Memory networks, we propose a novel end-to-end Bayesian deep model that provides time series prediction along with uncertainty estimation. We provide detailed experiments of the proposed solution on completed trips data, and successfully apply it to large-scale time series anomaly detection at Uber.},

When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).},
