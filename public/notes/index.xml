      <description>A list of Bayesian finance papers I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed. These are mostly sourced from the financial economics literature, and primarily so from the top three journals (Journal of Finance, Review of Financial Studies, and the Journal of Financial Economics). I exclude theoretical papers because the Bayesian component is usually not the most interesting part. I favor empirical papers that use some kind of Bayesian method. Suggestions welcome!
