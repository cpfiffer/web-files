      <description>I thought I’d start getting into Kaggle to work on some non-finance data to get a feel for the messiness of real-world information. Kaggle’s introductory competition is about predicting which passengers on the Titanic are going to survive using a handful of features, so let’s launch into mucking about. This post follows a “lab book” style and is quite scattered, as I develop ideas about what to do.

      <description>I thought I’d do a little bit of analysis to showcase some credit risk analysis, using logistic regression. I’ve pulled this sample loan data from a DataCamp course on credit risk. It’s a cool class, you should check it out if you have time. In a later post, I will try this same analysis with a neural network to see if it has better predictive capabilities.
Here’s a look at the data.</description>
