      <description>This article first appeared in the Reading University Investment Society&amp;rsquo;s April edition on April 16th, 2017.

This is in line with the central bank’s “slow and steady” approach to rate increases after a decade of historically low interest rates, and is the third such rate increase since June of 2006.</description>
