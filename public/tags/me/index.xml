      <description>&amp;#8853; 
&amp;#8853; It&amp;rsquo;s my jolly face!
I play with code and pianos.
I am a PhD student at the University of Oregon studying finance. I have a master&amp;rsquo;s in finance from the ICMA Centre at the Henley Business School (which itself is part of the University of Reading), and a BSc in Technical Theater from Southern Oregon University. I&amp;rsquo;m a developer for Turing.jl, a probabilistic programming tool.
My interests are pretty broad in finance, but in general I tend to favor situations where technology is involed (with some classic asset pricing stuff too):</description>
