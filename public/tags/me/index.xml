      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m looking for work! If you need a financial analyst, data scientist, or just a quick learner, you can contact me at cpfiffer@gmail.com.
I&amp;rsquo;m a graduate student in finance. I also play with code, and occasionally piano. This is a little website I built, partly as a portfolio of some of the stuff I can do, but also because it&amp;rsquo;s fun.
I have a master&amp;rsquo;s in finance from the ICMA Centre at the Henley Business School (which itself is part of the University of Reading1) Nominally, my degree is in corporate finance, though I&amp;rsquo;ve studied most business disciplines.</description>
