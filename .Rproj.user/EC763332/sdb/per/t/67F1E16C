I also play with code, and occasionally piano. This is a little website I built, partly as a portfolio of some of the stuff I can do, but also because it's fun.\n\nI have a master's in finance from the [ICMA Centre](http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/) at the [Henley Business School](http://www.henley.ac.uk/) (which itself is part of the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/)[^1]) Nominally, my degree is in corporate finance, though I've studied most business disciplines. I tend to use a lot of programming to handle the challenges in finance, and over time I'll populate this blog with some posts showcasing some of my best work.\n\n---\n## Skills\n\n### Finance\n* Liquidity Risk\n* Algorithmic, Systematic, and High Frequency Trading\n* Market Making\n* Corporate Finance\n* Equity Valuation\n* Market Research\n* Mergers & Acquisitions\n* Bloomberg Terminal\n* Reuters Eikon\n\n### Programming\n* R\n* Python\n* Matlab[^2]\n* SQL\n\n### Data Science\n* Neural Networks\n* Forecasting\n* Nonlinear Modeling\n* Econometric Theory\n* Principal Component Analysis\n* Exploratory Analysis\n\n[^1]: Yes, this is confusing, and it makes typing up resumes very difficult.\n[^2]: I say Matlab, but most of my experience has been with the GNU version called [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). The syntax and functions are pretty much identical, with only minor changes required to adapt.\n",
